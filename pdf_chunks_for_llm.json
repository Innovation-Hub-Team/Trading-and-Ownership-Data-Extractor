In particular, we\nconsidered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering\nfuture events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters\nconsideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\nWe tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into\naccount the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period.\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a\nseparate opinion on these matters.\n4"

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in\naccordance with International Standards on Auditing, that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we exercise professional judgement and\nmaintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\u25cf Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures\nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement\nresulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of\ninternal control.\n\u25cf Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose\nof expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.\n\u25cf Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n\u25cf Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty\nexists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty\nexists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,\nto modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause\nthe Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\u25cf Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial\nstatements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\u25cf Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business units within the Group as\na basis for forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for\npurposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n7"

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains\ncontrol over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets , liabilities, income and\nexpenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the statement of comprehensive\nincome from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.\nA change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If\nthe Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:\n\u2022 derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary\n\u2022 derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests\n\u2022 derecognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity\n\u2022 recognises the fair value of the consideration received\n\u2022 recognises the fair value of any investment retained\n\u2022 recognises any surplus or deficit in statement of income\n\u2022 reclassifies the parent\u2019s share of components previously recognised in OCI to statement of income or retained\nearnings, as appropriate, as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or\nliabilities.\nBalances between the Bank and its subsidiaries including any income, expenses, assets, liabilities, equities and\ncashflow arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing these consolidated financial statements.\nUnrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence\nof impairment. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies and\nvaluation methods for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. The accounting policies of\nsubsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group.\nInternal Use"

Material accounting policies (continued)\n(i) List of significant subsidiaries\nThe table below provides details of the major subsidiaries of the Group:\nOwnership interest\nName of the subsidiary Principal place of business\n2024 2023\nSaudi Fransi Capital (SFC) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 100% 100%\nSaudi Fransi for Finance Leasing (JB) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 100% 100%\nApart from the above subsidiaries, the Bank also owns Saudi Fransi Insurance Agency, Sakan Real Estate Financing,\nSofinco Saudi Fransi, BSF Markets Limited, BSF Finance Limited, Saudi Fransi Digital Ventures, and Sur Multi Family\nOffice having 100% share in equity. BSF Markets Limited and BSF Finance Limited are incorporated in the Cayman\nIslands. Sofinco Saudi Fransi, Saudi Fransi Insurance Agency and Sakan Real Estate Financing have no material impact\non the Group financial statements.\nAll subsidiaries are 100% owned by the Group hence no non-controlling interest is recognised in these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nThe group acts as Fund Manager to a number of investment funds. Determining whether the group controls such an\ninvestment fund usually focuses on the assessment of the aggregate economic interests of the Group in the Fund\n(comprising any carried interests and expected management fees) and the investors rights to remove the Fund Manager.\nAs a result, the Group has concluded that it acts as an agent for the investors in all cases, and therefore has not\nconsolidated these funds\n(ii) Significant restriction\nThe Group does not have significant restrictions on its ability to access or use its assets and settle its liabilities other\nthan those resulting from the supervisory frameworks within which banking subsidiaries operate.\nB. Investment in associates\nInvestments in associates are initially recognised at cost and subsequently accounted for under the equity method of\naccounting.\nAn associate is an entity in which the Bank has significant influence (but not control), over financial and operating\npolicies and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture.\nInvestments in associates are carried in the statement of financial position at cost, plus post-acquisition changes in the\nBank\u2019s share of net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. The Bank\u2019s\nshares of its associates\u2019 post-acquisition profits or losses are recognized in the consolidated statement of income, and\nits share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognized in reserves. The cumulative\npost-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.\nWhen the Bank\u2019s share of losses in an associate equal or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other\nunsecured receivables, the Bank does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made\npayments on behalf of the associate.\nUnder the equity method, the investment in the associate is carried on the statement of financial position at cost plus\npost acquisition changes in the Group\u2019s share of net assets of the associate. Goodwill relating to the associate is\nincluded in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment.\nInternal Use"

Material accounting policies (continued)\nThe statement of income reflects the Group\u2019s share of the results of operations of the associate. When there has been a\nchange recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses\nthis, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains on transactions are eliminated to the\nextent of the Group\u2019s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides\nevidence of impairment in the asset transferred.\nThe Group\u2019s share of profit of an associate is shown on the face of the statement of income. This is the profit\nattributable to equity holders of the associate and, therefore, is profit after tax and non-controlling interests in the\nsubsidiaries of the associate. The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as\nthe Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.\nAfter application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an additional\nimpairment loss on its investment in its associate. The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any\nobjective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount\nof impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises\nthe amount in the \u2018share of profit of an associate\u2019 in the statement of income.\nWhen the Bank ceases to equity account for an investment because of a loss of control, joint control or significant\ninfluence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount\nrecognised in profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently\naccounting for the retained interest as an associate or financial asset.\nC. Classification of financial assets\nOn initial recognition, a financial asset is classified into following categories: amortized cost, FVOCI or FVSI.\nFinancial asset at amortized cost\nA financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at\nFVSI:\n\u2022 the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows;\nand\n\u2022 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments\nof principal and interest.\nFinancial Asset at Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)\nA debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at\nFVSI:\n\u2022 the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash\nflows and selling financial assets; and\n\u2022 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments\nof principal and interest.\nFVOCI debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising due to changes in fair\nvalue recognised in OCI. Interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in consolidated\nstatement of income."

Material accounting policies (continued)\nEquity Instruments: On initial recognition, for an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may\nirrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-\ninvestment basis.\nFinancial asset at Fair value through statement of income (FVSI)\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI are classified at FVSI.\nIn addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the\nrequirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI as at FVSI if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces\nan accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\nFinancial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Group changes\nits business model for managing financial assets.\nBusiness model assessment\nThe Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level\nbecause this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The\ninformation considered includes:\n\u2022 the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular,\nwhether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a particular\ninterest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are\nfunding those assets or realizing cash flows through the sale of the assets\n\u2022 how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management\n\u2022 the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business\nmodel) and how those risks are managed\n\u2022 how managers of the business are compensated - e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the\nassets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and\n\u2022 the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations\nabout future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part\nof an overall assessment of how the Group's stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved\nand how cash flows are realized.\nThe business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case\u2019\nscenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Group's\noriginal expectations, the Group does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that\nbusiness model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial\nassets going forward.\nFinancial assets that are held for trading and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at\nFVSI because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and\nto sell financial assets.\nInternal Use"

Material accounting policies (continued)\nAssessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest\nFor the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 'Interest' is\nthe consideration for the time value of money, the credit and other basic lending risk associated with the principal\namount outstanding during a particular period and other basic lending costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs),\nalong with profit margin.\nIn assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the\ncontractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term\nthat could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making\nthe assessment, the Group considers:\n\u2022 contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows\n\u2022 leverage features\n\u2022 prepayment and extension terms\n\u2022 terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse asset arrangements)\nand\n\u2022 features that modify consideration of the time value of money e.g. periodical reset of interest rates.\nDesignation at FVSI\nAt initial recognition, the Group has designated certain financial assets at FVSI.\nReclassification\nReclassification of financial assets is warranted when business model for managing financial assets is changed.\nThe following are not considered to be changes in business model:\n\u2022 A change in intention related to particular financial assets (even in circumstances of significant changes in market\nconditions);\n\u2022 A temporary disappearance of a particular market for financial assets; or\n\u2022 A transfer of financial assets between parts of the Groups\u2019s assets with different business models.\nConditions for reclassification of financial assets\nReclassifications are expected to be infrequent. Such changes must be determined by the Group\u2019s senior management\nand approved by the Board Executive Committee as a result of external or internal changes and must be significant to\nGroup\u2019s operations and demonstrable to external parties. Accordingly, a change in Group\u2019s business model will occur\nonly when the Group either begins or ceases to perform an activity that is significant to its operations; for example,\nwhen the Group acquires, disposes of or terminates a business line.\nTiming of reclassification of financial assets\nIf the Group reclassifies financial assets, it is required to apply the reclassification prospectively from the reclassification\ndate, defined as the first day of the first reporting period following the change in business model that results in\nreclassification. On reclassification, all previously recognized gains, losses (including impairment gains or losses) or\nprofits are not restated. A change in the objective of the Group\u2019s business model must be affected before the\nreclassification date.\nInternal Use"

Classification of financial liabilities\nThe Group classifies its financial liabilities, other than financial guarantees, letter of credit and loan commitments, as\nmeasured at amortized cost. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on issue\nfunds, and costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate (EIR).\nWhere an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the\nterms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition\nof the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference between the carrying value of the original\nfinancial liability and the consideration paid is recognised in consolidated statement of income.\nE. Offsetting financial instruments\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and reported net in the statement of financial position when there is a legally\nenforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and when the Group intends to settle on a net basis, or to realise\nthe asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nIncome and expenses are not offset in the consolidated statement of income unless required or permitted by any\naccounting standard or interpretation, and as specifically disclosed in the accounting policies of the Group.\nF. Derecognition\nFinancial assets\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset, such as a loan to a customer, when the terms and conditions have been\nrenegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new loan, with the difference recognised as a derecognition\ngain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded.\nInternal Use"

Material accounting policies (continued)\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire,\nor it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and\nrewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains\nsubstantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.\nOn derecognition of a financial asset (Debt Instruments), the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or\nthe carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognized) and the sum of (i) the consideration received\n(including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been\nrecognized in OCI is recognized in profit or loss.\nWhen assets are sold to a third party with a concurrent total rate of return swap on the transferred assets, the\ntransaction is accounted for as a secured financing transaction similar to sale-and repurchase transactions, as the\nGroup retains all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of such assets.\nIn transactions in which the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and Rewards of ownership\nof a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Group continues to recognize the asset to the extent of its\ncontinuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred\nasset.\nIn certain transactions, the Group retains the obligation to service the transferred financial asset for a fee. The\ntransferred asset is derecognized if it meets the derecognition criteria. An asset or liability is recognized for the\nservicing contract, if the servicing fee is more than adequate (asset) or is less than adequate (liability) for performing\nthe servicing.\nThe Group securitizes various loans and advances to customers and investment securities, which generally result in\nthe sale of these assets to unconsolidated securitization vehicles and in the Group transferring substantially all of the\nrisks and rewards of ownership. The securitization vehicles in turn issue securities to investors. Interests in the\nsecuritized financial assets are generally retained in the form of senior or subordinated tranches, interest-only strips or\nother residual interests (retained interests). Retained interests are recognized as investment securities and carried at\nFVOCI. Gains or losses on securitization are recorded in other revenue.\nAny cumulative gain/loss recognized in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI is not\nrecognized in profit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify\nfor derecognition that is created or retained by the Group is recognized as a separate asset or liability.\nFinancial liabilities\nThe Group derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire.\nG. Modifications of financial assets and financial liabilities\nFinancial assets\nIf the terms of a financial asset are modified, the Group evaluates whether the cash flows of the modified asset are\nsubstantially different. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the\noriginal financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognized and a new\nfinancial asset is recognized at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs.

In this case, the Group recalculates the gross carrying amount of\nthe financial asset using the original effective commission rate of the asset and recognizes the amount arising from\nadjusting the gross carrying amount as a modification gain or loss in consolidated statement of income. For floating-\nrate financial assets, the original effective commission rate used to calculate the modification gain or loss is adjusted to\nreflect current market terms at the time of the modification. Any costs of fees incurred and modification fees received\nadjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the\nmodified financial asset.\nFinancial liabilities\nThe Group derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are\nsubstantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value. The\ndifference between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability with modified\nterms is recognized in profit or loss.\nIf the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortized cost of the liability is\nrecalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is\nrecognized in consolidated statement of income. For financial liabilities, the Group considers a modification to be\nsubstantial based on qualitative factors and if it results in a difference between the adjusted discounted present value\nand the original carrying amount of the financial liability of, or greater than, ten percent.\nH.

This amount is\nincluded in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of\nderecognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.\nCredit-impaired financial assets\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets including lease receivable carried at amortized\ncost, debt financial assets carried at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more\nevents that have detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.\nEvidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\u2022 significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer\n\u2022 a breach of contract such as a default or past due event\n\u2022 the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise\n\u2022 it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; or\n\u2022 the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\nA loan that has been renegotiated due to deterioration in the borrower's condition is usually considered to be credit-\nimpaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and\nthere are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered\nimpaired.\nIn assessing whether an investment in sovereign debt is credit-impaired, the Group considers the following factors:\n\u2022 the market's assessment of creditworthiness as reflected in the bond yields\n\u2022 the rating agencies' assessments of creditworthiness\n\u2022 the country's ability to access the capital markets for new debt issuance\n\u2022 the probability of debt being restructured, resulting in holders suffering losses through voluntary or mandatory\ndebt forgiveness\n\u2022 the international support mechanisms in place to provide the necessary support as 'lender of last resort' to that\ncountry, as well as the intention, reflected in public statements, of governments and agencies to use those\nmechanisms.

This is generally the case when the Group determines that the\nborrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts\nsubject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level.\nRecoveries of amounts previously written off are recognised when the cash is received and are included in \u201cImpairment\ncharge for expected credit losses on loans and advances, net\u201d in the consolidated statement of income\nFinancial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group\u2019s\nprocedures for recovery of amounts due.\nI. Financial guarantees, letter of credits and loan commitments\n'Financial guarantees' are contracts that require the Group to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a\nloss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in accordance with the terms of a\ndebt instrument.\nThe premium received is recognised in the income statement in Net fees and commission income on a straight-line\nbasis over the life of the guarantee.\n'Loan commitments and letter of credits' are firm commitments under which, over the duration of the commitments, the\nGroup is required to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions Similar to financial guarantee contracts,\nthese contracts are in the scope of the ECL requirements.\nThe nominal contractual value of financial guarantees, letters of credit and loan commitments, where the loan agreed to\nbe provided is on market terms, are not recorded on in the statement of financial position. The nominal values of these\ninstruments together with the corresponding ECL is recorded.\nFinancial guarantees issued or commitments to provide loan at a below market interest rate are initially measured at\nfair value. Subsequently, they are measured at the higher of the loss allowance determined in accordance with IFRS 9\nand the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognized in\naccordance with the principle of ISFRS 15. Other loan commitments issued are measured at the sum of (i) the loss\nallowance determined in accordance with IFRS 9 and (ii) the amount of any fees received, less, if the commitment is\nunlikely to result in a specific lending arrangement, the cumulative amount of income recognized.\n\u2022 The Group issued no loan commitment that are measured at FVSI.\n\u2022 Liabilities arising from financial guarantees and loan commitments are included within provisions.\nJ. Derivatives financial instruments and hedge accounting\nDerivative financial instruments including forward foreign exchange contracts, commission rate futures, forward rate\nagreements, currency and commission rate swaps, and currency and commission rate options (both written and\npurchased) are measured at fair value. All derivatives are carried at their fair value as assets where the fair value is\npositive and as liabilities where the fair value is negative. Fair values are obtained by reference to quoted market prices,\ndiscounted cash flow models and pricing models, as appropriate.\nInternal Use"

Material accounting policies (continued)\nThe Group is using IAS-39 for Hedge Accounting.\nThe treatment of changes in their fair value depends on their classification into the following categories:\n(i) Derivatives held for trading\nAny changes in the fair value of derivatives that are held for trading purposes are taken directly to the consolidated\nstatement of income and disclosed in Gain / (Loss) on FVSI Financial Instruments, net. Derivatives held for trading also\ninclude those derivatives, which do not qualify for hedge accounting.\n(ii) Embedded derivatives\nDerivatives may be embedded in another contractual arrangement (a host contract). The Group accounts for an\nembedded derivative separately from the host contract when:\n\u2022 the host contract is not an asset in the scope of IFRS 9;\n\u2022 the terms of the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative if they were contained in a\nseparate contract; and\n\u2022 the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic\ncharacteristics and risks of the host contract.\nSeparated embedded derivatives are measured at fair value, with all changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss\nunless they form part of a qualifying cash flow or net investment hedging relationship.\n(iii) Hedge accounting\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in qualifying hedging relationships to manage\nexposures to interest rate, foreign currency, and credit risks, including exposures arising from highly probable forecast\ntransactions and firm commitments. In order to manage particular risk, the Group applies hedge accounting for\ntransactions that meet specific criteria.\nFor the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified into two categories: (a) fair value hedges which hedge the\nexposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability, (or assets or liabilities in case of portfolio\nhedging), or an unrecognised firm commitment or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment,\nthat is attributable to a particular risk and could affect the reported net gain or loss; and (b) cash flow hedges which\nhedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised\nasset or liability or to a highly probable forecasted transaction that will affect the reported net gain or loss.\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge should be expected to be highly effective, i.e. the changes in fair\nvalue or cash flows of the hedging instrument should effectively offset corresponding changes in the hedged item, and\nshould be reliably measurable. At inception of the hedge, the risk management objective and strategy are\ndocumented including the identification of the hedging instrument, the related hedged item, the nature of risk being\nhedged, and how the Group will assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. Subsequently, the hedge is\nrequired to be assessed and determined to be an effective hedge on an on-going basis. At each hedge effectiveness\nassessment date, a hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective on a prospective basis and\ndemonstrate that it was effective (retrospective effectiveness) for the designated period in order to qualify for hedge\naccounting.\nInternal Use"

Material accounting policies (continued)\nA formal assessment is undertaken by comparing the hedging instrument\u2019s effectiveness in offsetting the changes in\nfair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk in the hedged item, both at inception and at each quarter end\non an ongoing basis. Prospective testing is performed mainly through matching the critical terms of both hedge item\nand instrument.\nA hedge is expected to be highly effective if the changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk\nduring the period for which the hedge is designated were offset by the hedging instrument in a range of 80% to 125%\nand were expected to achieve such offset in future periods. Hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in the income\nstatement in \u2018Net trading income\u2019. For situations where the hedged item is a forecast transaction, the Group also\nassesses whether the transaction is highly probable and presents an exposure to variations in cash flows that could\nultimately affect the consolidated statement of income.\nFair value hedges\nWhen a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the change in fair value of a recognised\nasset or liability or a firm commitment that could affect consolidated statement of income, any gain or loss from re-\nmeasuring the hedging instruments to fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of income\ntogether with change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk under non-trading gains /\nlosses in the consolidated statement of income.\nFor hedged items measured at amortised cost, where the fair value hedge of a commission bearing financial\ninstrument ceases to meet the criteria for hedge accounting or is sold, exercised or terminated, the difference between\nthe carrying value of the hedged item on termination and the face value is amortised over the remaining term of the\noriginal hedge using the effective commission rate method, (the hedge item is also fair-valued). If the hedged item is\nderecognised, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of\nincome.\nMicro fair value hedges\nA fair value hedge relationship is a \u2019Micro fair value hedge\u2019 when the hedged item (or group of items) is a distinctively\nidentifiable asset or liability hedged by one or a few hedging instruments. The financial instruments hedged for interest\nrate risk in a micro fair value hedge relationship include fixed rate corporate and small business loans, fixed rate debt\ninstruments at FVOCI and fixed rate issued long-term deposits. These hedge relationships are assessed for\nprospective and retrospective hedge effectiveness on a monthly basis. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold,\nterminated or exercised, or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, or the Group decides\nto voluntarily discontinue the hedging relationship, the hedge relationship is discontinued prospectively.\nIf the relationship does not meet the hedge effectiveness criteria, the Group discontinues hedge accounting from the\nlast date on which compliance with hedge effectiveness was demonstrated. If the hedge accounting relationship is\nterminated for an item recorded at amortised cost, the accumulated fair value hedge adjustment to the carrying\namount of the hedged item is amortised over the remaining term of the original hedge by recalculating the EIR. If the\nhedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the income\nstatement.\nFor fair value hedge relationships where the hedged item is not measured at amortised cost, such as debt instruments\nat FVOCI, changes in fair value that were recorded in the income statement whilst hedge accounting was in place are\namortised in a similar way to amortised cost instruments using the EIR method. However, as these instruments are\nmeasured at their fair values in the statement of financial position, the fair value hedge adjustments are transferred\nfrom the income statement to OCI.\nInternal Use"

Material accounting policies (continued)\nCash flow hedges\nFor designated and qualifying cash flow hedging, derivatives instruments in a hedge of a variability in cash flows\nattributable to a particular risk associated with recognised asset or a liability or a highly probable forecast transaction\nthat could affect the consolidated statement of income, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is\ndetermined to be an effective portion is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion,\nif any, is recognised in the consolidated statement of income. For cash flow hedges affecting future transactions, the\ngains or losses recognised in other reserves, are transferred to the consolidated statement of income in the same\nperiod in which the hedged item affects the consolidated statement of income. However, if the Group expects that all\nor a portion of a loss recognized in other comprehensive income will not be recovered in one or more future periods, it\nshall reclassify into the consolidated statement of income as a reclassification adjustment the amount that is not to be\nrecognized.\nWhere the hedged forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability,\nthen at the time such asset or liability is recognised the associated gains or losses that had previously been\nrecognised directly in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or\nother carrying amount of such asset or liability.\nWhen the hedging instrument is expired or sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting,\nor the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur or the Group revokes the designation then hedge\naccounting is discontinued prospectively. At that point of time, any cumulative gain or loss on the cash flow hedging\ninstrument that was recognised in other comprehensive income from the period when the hedge was effective is\ntransferred from equity to consolidated statement of income when the forecasted transaction occurs. Where the\nhedged forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur and affects the consolidated statement of income, the\nnet cumulative gain or loss recognised in \u201cother comprehensive income\u201d is transferred immediately to the consolidated\nstatement of income for the period.\nK. Foreign currencies\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the\nexchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign\ncurrency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined.\nThe gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the\nrecognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair\nvalue gain or loss is recognised in OCI or profit or loss are also recognised in OCI or profit or loss, respectively).\nIn determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or part of\nit) on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability relating to advance consideration, the date\nof the transaction is the date on which the Group initially recognises the non- monetary asset or non-monetary liability\narising from the advance consideration. If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the Group determines\nthe transaction date for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into Saudi Arabian Riyals at the spot rates prevailing at transaction\ndates. Monetary assets and liabilities at year-end denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Saudi Arabian\nRiyals at rates of exchange prevailing at the reporting date.\nInternal Use"

Material accounting policies (continued)\nM. Settlement and trade date accounting\nAll regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized in the consolidated\nstatement of financial position on the settlement date i.e. the date on which the asset is acquired from or delivered to\nthe counter party. The Group accounts for any change in fair value which is recognized from the trade date.\nRegular purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time\nframe generally established by regulation or follow convention in the market place.\nAll other financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to\nthe contractual provisions of the instrument.\nN. Fair value measurement\nThe Group measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives and equity instruments and non-financial assets such\nas investment properties, at fair value at each statement of financial position date. Also, fair values of financial\ninstruments measured at amortized cost are disclosed in note 36.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement date in the principle or, in its absence, the most advantageous market\nto which the Group has access at that date. The Fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.\nWhen one is available, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted prices in an active market\nfor that instrument. A market is regarded as \u2018active\u2019 if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient\nfrequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nIf there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Group uses the valuation techniques that maximize the use of\nrelevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates\nall of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction.\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset considers a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits\nby using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its\nhighest and best use.\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are\ncategorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the\nfair value measurement as a whole:\n\u2022 Level 1 \u2014 Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n\u2022 Level 2 \u2014 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement is directly or indirectly observable\n\u2022 Level 3 \u2014 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement is unobservable\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognised in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group\ndetermines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on\nthe lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period."

Material accounting policies (continued)\nThe Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. This framework\nincludes a Market Risk Department, which is independent of front office management and reports to the Chief Risk\nOfficer, and which has overall responsibility for independently verifying the results of trading and investment operations\nand all significant fair value measurements. Specific controls include:\n\u2022 verification of observable pricing;\n\u2022 calibration of model valuations;\n\u2022 a review and approval process for new models and changes to models involving Risk Division\nTo dynamically address valuation issues, within the Market Risk Committee, which is held every quarter, a Valuation\nSub-Committee may be held to review and determine by consensus adjustments of valuation methodologies at the\nrequest of the Market Risk Committee members.\nThe Market Risk Committee comprises of Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Treasurer &\nInvestment Officer, the Head of Institutional Banking Group, the Chief Risk Officer and the Head of Market Risk.\nO. Deposits, debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities\nWhen the Group designates a financial liability as at FVSI, the amount of change in the fair value of the liability that is\nattributable to changes in its credit risk is presented in OCI as a liability credit reserve.\nOn initial recognition of the financial liability, the Group assesses whether presenting the amount of change in the fair\nvalue of the liability that is attributable to credit risk in OCI would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or\nloss. This assessment is made by using a regression analysis to compare:\n\u2022 the expected changes in the fair value of the liability related to changes in the credit risk; with\n\u2022 the impact on profit or loss of expected changes in fair value of the related instruments.\nP. Tier 1 Sukuk\nThe determination of equity classification of Tier 1 Sukuk requires significant judgement as certain clauses of the\nOffering Circular require interpretation. The Group classifies Sukuk issued (as equity) with no fixed\nredemption/maturity dates (Perpetual Sukuk) and not obliging the Group for payment of profit upon the occurrence of\na non-payment event or non-payment election by the Group subject to certain terms and conditions and essentially\nmean that the remedies available to sukuk holders are limited in number and scope and very difficult to exercise.\nThe related initial costs and distributions thereon are recognised directly in the consolidated statement of changes in\nequity under retained earnings.\nQ.

Any subsequent revaluation gain in the fair value less costs to sell of these assets\nto the extent this does not exceed the cumulative write down is recognised in the consolidated statement of income.\nGains or losses on disposal are recognised in the consolidated statement of income.\nCollateral valuation\nTo mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Group seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes\nin various forms, such as cash, securities, letters of credit/guarantees, real estate, receivables, inventories, other non-\nfinancial assets and credit enhancements such as netting agreements. Collateral, unless repossessed, is not recorded\non the Group\u2019s statement of financial position. However, the fair value of collateral affects the calculation of ECLs. It is\ngenerally assessed, at a minimum, at inception and re-assessed on a periodic basis. However, some collateral, for\nexample, cash or securities relating to margining requirements, is valued daily.\nTo the extent possible, the Group uses active market data for valuing financial assets held as collateral. Other financial\nassets which do not have readily determinable market values are valued using models. Non-financial collateral, such as\nreal estate, is valued based on data provided by third parties such as mortgage brokers, or based on housing price\nindices.\nCollateral repossessed\nThe Group\u2019s policy is to determine whether a repossessed asset can be best used for its internal operations or should\nbe sold.\nAssets determined to be useful for the internal operations are transferred to their relevant asset category at fair value.\nAssets for which selling is determined to be a better option are transferred to assets held for sale at their fair value (if\nfinancial assets) and fair value less cost to sell for non-financial assets at the repossession date in, line with the\nGroup\u2019s policy.\nIn its normal course of business, the Group does not physically repossess properties or other assets in its retail\nportfolio, but engages external agents to recover funds, generally at auction, to settle outstanding debt. Any surplus\nfunds are returned to the customers/obligors. As a result of this practice, the residential properties under legal\nrepossession processes are not recorded on the statement of financial position.\nT. Provisions\nProvisions are measured at the present value of management\u2019s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the\npresent obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-\ntax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The\nincrease in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.\nProvisions for liabilities and charges\nThe Group receives legal claims against it in the normal course of business. Management has made judgments as to\nthe likelihood of any claim succeeding in making provisions. The time of concluding legal claims is uncertain, as is the\namount of possible outflow of economic benefits. Timing and cost ultimately depends on the due process being\nfollowed as per law."

Material accounting policies (continued)\nU. Accounting for leases\nRight of Use Asset (RoU) / Lease Liabilities\nOn initial recognition, at inception of the contract, the Group shall assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease.\nA contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period\nof time in exchange for consideration. Control is identified if most of the benefits are flowing to the group and the\ngroup can direct the usage of such assets.\nAt inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration\nin the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices. However, for the leases of\nland and buildings in which it is a lessee, the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account\nfor the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\nRight of Use Assets\nThe Group applies the cost model, and measures right of use assets at cost:\nI. less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses; and\nII. adjusted for any re-measurement of the lease liability for lease modifications.\nGenerally, the RoU asset would be equal to the lease liability. However, if there are additional costs such as site\npreparation, non-refundable deposits, application money, other expenses related to transaction etc. These would\nneed to be added to the RoU asset value.\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the\nearlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of\nright-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment.\nLease Liability\nOn initial recognition, the lease liability is the present value of all remaining payments to the lessor, discounted using\nthe interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group's incremental borrowing\nrate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\nAfter the commencement date, Group measures the lease liability by:\nI. increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability\nII. reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and;\nII. re-measuring the carrying amount to reflect any re-assessment or lease modification\nThe lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a\nchange in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group's estimate\nof the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment of\nwhether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the\nright-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to\nzero.\nInternal Use"

End of service benefits\nBenefits payable to the employees of the Group at the end of their services are accrued based on actuarial valuation\nconducted by an independent actuary, taking into account the provision of the Saudi Arabian Labor Law.\nNet obligation, with respect to end of service benefits, to the Group is reviewed by using a projected unit credit\nmethod. Actuarial gains and losses (Re-measurements) are recognized in full in the period in which they occur in\nother comprehensive income. Re-measurements are not reclassified to consolidated statement of income in\nsubsequent periods.\nInterest expense is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability.

Market and non-vesting conditions are reflected in the initial measurement\nof fair value with no subsequent true-up if the conditions are not satisfied.\nZ. Zakat\nZakat\nThe Group is subject to Zakat in accordance with the regulations of ZATCA (Zakat, Tax & Customs Authority). Zakat\nexpense is charged to the consolidated statement of income. Zakat is not accounted for as income tax and as such no\ndeferred tax is calculated relating to zakat.\nValue Added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d)\nThe Group collects VAT from its customers for qualifying services provided and makes VAT payments to its vendors\nfor qualifying payments. On a monthly basis, net VAT remittances are made to the ZATCA representing VAT collected\nfrom its customers, net of any recoverable VAT on payments.

Government grant\nThe Group recognizes a government grant related to income, if there is a reasonable assurance that it will be received\nand the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. The benefit of a government deposit at a\nbelow-market rate of interest is treated as a government grant related to income. The below-market rate deposit is\nrecognised and measured in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. The benefit of the below-market rate of\ninterest is measured as the difference between the initial carrying value of the deposit determined in accordance with\nIFRS 9 and the proceeds received. The benefit is accounted for in accordance with IAS 20. Government grant is\nrecognised in consolidated statement of income on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Group recognises\nas expenses the related costs for which the grant is intended to compensate. The grant income is only recognised\nwhen the ultimate beneficiary is the Group. Where the customer is the ultimate beneficiary, the Group only records the\nrespective receivable and payable amounts.\nAD. Revenue / expenses recognition\nSpecial commission income and expenses\nSpecial commission income and expense are recognized in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The\n'effective interest rate' is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the\nexpected life of the financial instrument or the amortized cost of the financial instrument.\nWhen calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than credit-impaired assets, the Group\nestimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not expected credit losses.\nFor credit-impaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated using estimated future cash\nflows including expected credit losses.\nThe calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees and royalty/reward points paid or\nreceived that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are\ndirectly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability.\nInternal Use"

Material accounting policies (continued)\nAn incremental cost is one that would not have been incurred if the entity had not acquired, issued or disposed of the\nfinancial instrument. Transaction costs include fees and commission paid to agents (including employees acting as\nselling agents), advisers, brokers and dealers, levies by regulatory agencies and security exchanges, and transfer\ntaxes and duties. Transaction costs do not include debt premiums or discounts, financing costs or internal\nadministrative or holding costs.\nAll fees paid or received between parties to the contract (e.g. between a lender and a borrower) that are included in the\ncalculation of the effective interest rate (EIR) are amortized over the expected life of the financial instrument, unless\nthey relate to a shorter period. The shorter period is used when the variable to which the fees, transaction costs,\npremiums or discounts relate is repriced to market rates before the expected maturity of the financial instrument. For\nfinancial instruments measured at FVSI, fees are recognised in consolidated statement of income in full when the\ninstrument is initially recognised.\nMeasurement of amortized cost and special commission income and expense\nThe 'amortized cost' of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability\nis measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the\neffective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial\nassets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance.\nThe 'gross carrying amount of a financial asset' is the amortized cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any\nexpected credit loss allowance.\nIn calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the\nasset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortized cost of the liability.\nHowever, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is\ncalculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer\ncredit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.\nFor financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the credit-\nadjusted effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the asset. The calculation of interest income does not revert to a\ngross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves.\nAE. Fees and commission income\nFee and commission income and expense that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset or financial\nliability are included in the special commission income / expense as applicable.\nOther fee and commission income \u2013 including account servicing fees, sales commission, placement fees and\nsyndication fees \u2013 are recognised as the related services are performed. If a loan commitment is not expected to\nresult in the draw-down of a loan, then the related loan commitment fee is recognised on a straight-line basis over the\ncommitment period.\nOther fee and commission expenses relate mainly to transaction and service fees, which are expensed as the\nservices are received.\nThe Group provides various services to its customer. These services are either rendered separately or bundled\ntogether with rendering of other services.\nInternal Use"

Material accounting policies (continued)\nThe Group has concluded that revenue from rendering of various services related to share trading, corporate finance\nand advisory and other banking services, are recognized at the point when services are rendered i.e. when\nperformance obligation is satisfied. Whereas revenue from trade finance, fund management and fee services related to\ncredit card is recognized over the period of time.\nBrokerage income\nBrokerage income is recognised when the related transactions are executed on behalf of the customers at the price\nagreed in the contract with the customers, net of discounts and rebates. The performance obligation of the Group is\nsatisfied when the Group carries out the transaction, which is considered as a performance obligation satisfied at a\npoint in time, which triggers immediate recognition of the revenue, as the Group will have no further commitments.\nAsset management fees\nAsset management fees are recognised based on a fixed percentage of net assets under management (\u201casset-based\u201d),\nor a percentage of returns from net assets (\u201creturns-based\u201d), or a percentage of capital deployed/raised subject to\napplicable terms and conditions and service contracts with customers and funds. The Group attributes the revenue\nfrom management fees to the services provided during the period, because the fee relates specifically to the Group\u2019s\nefforts to transfer the services for that period. As asset management fees are not subject to claw backs, the\nmanagement does not expect any significant reversal of revenue previously recognised.\nThis fee compensates and contributes to single performance obligations, the Group\u2019s obligation will generally be\nsatisfied upon the provision of non-restrictive legal custodial structure and therefore recognized over time as the overall\nservices are performed.\nAdvisory and investment banking services revenue\nAdvisory and investment banking services revenue is recognised based on services rendered under the applicable\nservice contract.\nRevenue recognition of retainer fees is recognized over a period of time and it is generally linked to the timing of the\nperformance obligation (i.e., monthly, quarterly, etc.).\nSuccess fees are recognized upon the fulfillment of performance obligations. For example, either on the satisfaction of\nfinancial advisory services or completion of underwriting agreement.\nUnderwriting fees\nUnderwriting fees are recognized when the Group has rendered all services to the issuer and is entitled to collect the\nfee from the issuer with no contingencies associated with the fees. Underwriting revenues are presented net of\ntransaction-related expenses.\nCustody Fee\nCustody fee is received upfront and amortised over the period of the service (deferred income).\nInternal Use"

Derivatives\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Group utilizes the following derivative financial instruments for both trading and\nhedging purposes:\na) Swaps\nSwaps are commitments to exchange one set of cash flows for another. For commission rate swaps, counterparties\ngenerally exchange fixed and floating rate commission payments in a single currency without exchanging principal.\nFor currency rate swaps, fixed and floating commission payments and principal are exchanged in different currencies.\nb) Forwards and futures\nForwards and futures are contractual agreements to either buy or sell a specified currency, commodity or financial\ninstrument at a specified price and date in the future. Forwards are customized contracts transacted in the over the\ncounter market. Foreign currency and commission rate futures are transacted in standardized amounts on regulated\nexchanges and changes in futures contract values are settled daily.\nc) Forward rate agreements\nForward rate agreements are individually negotiated commission rate contracts that call for a cash settlement for the\ndifference between a contracted commission rate and the market rate on a specified future date, on a notional\nprincipal for an agreed period of time.\nd) Options\nOptions are contractual agreements under which the seller (writer) grants the purchaser (holder) the right, but not the\nobligation, to either buy or sell at fixed future date or at any time during a specified period, a specified amount of a\ncurrency, commodity or financial instrument at a pre-determined price.\nHeld for trading purposes\nMost of the Group\u2019s derivative trading activities relate to sales, positioning and arbitrage. Sales activities involve\noffering products to customers, Banks and other financial institutions in order, inter alia, to enable them to transfer,\nmodify or reduce current and future risks. Positioning involves managing market risk positions with the expectation of\nprofiting from favorable movements in prices, rates or indices. Arbitrage involves identifying, with the expectation of\nprofiting from price differentials between markets or products. The Group also holds structured derivative which are\nfully back to back in accordance with the Group\u2019s risk management strategy.\nInternal Use"

Derivatives (continued)\nHeld for hedging purposes\nThe Group has adopted a comprehensive system for the measurement and the management of risk. Part of the risk\nmanagement process involves managing the Group\u2019s exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and commission\nrates to reduce its exposure to currency and commission rate risks to an acceptable level as determined by the Board\nof Directors in accordance with the guidelines issued by SAMA.\nThe Board of Directors have established the levels of currency risk by setting limits on counterparty and currency\nposition exposures. Positions are monitored on a daily basis and hedging strategies are used to ensure positions are\nmaintained within the established limits. The Board of Directors have also established the level of commission rate\nrisk by setting commission rate sensitivity limits. Commission rate exposure in terms of the sensitivity is reviewed on a\nperiodic basis and hedging strategies are used to reduce the exposure within the established limits.\nAs part of its asset and liability management the Group uses derivatives for hedging purposes in order to adjust its\nown exposure to currency and commission rate risks. This is generally achieved by hedging specific transactions as\nwell as strategic hedging against overall consolidated statement of financial position exposures. Strategic hedging\ndoes not qualify for special hedge accounting and the related derivatives are accounted for as held for trading.\nThe Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and currency rate swaps to hedge against currency risks. In\naddition, the Group uses commission rate swaps and commission rate futures to hedge against the commission rate\nrisk arising from specifically identified fixed commission rate exposures.\nThe Group also uses commission rate swaps to hedge against the cash flow risk arising on certain floating rate\nexposures. In all such cases, the hedging relationship and objective, including details of the hedged items and\nhedging instrument are formally documented and the transactions are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges.\nCash flow hedges\nThe Group is exposed to variability in future special commission income cash flows on non-trading assets and\nliabilities which bear variable commission rate.

Derivatives (continued)\nThe Bank has posted SAR 2,304 million (2023: SAR 2,006 million) and received SAR 746 million (2023: SAR 779\nmillion) collaterals under Credit Support Annex (CSA) agreements and European Market Infrastructure Regulation\n(EMIR).\nThe Bank does not have ineffective portion of hedges that have been transferred to consolidated statement of income\nduring 2024 and 2023.\nThe Bank has calculated the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) based on an internal model to derive the difference\nbetween the risk-free portfolio and the true portfolio value that takes into account the possibility of a counterparty's\ndefault. CVA represents the market value of the counterparty credit risk. CVA is an adjustment to the fair value (or\nprice) of derivative instruments to account for counterparty credit risk (CCR). Thus, CVA is viewed as the price of CCR.\nThis price depends on counterparty credit spreads as well as on the market risk factors that drive derivatives\u2019 values\nand, therefore, exposure.\nThe Bank, as part of its derivative management activities, has entered into a master agreement in accordance with the\nInternational Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA) directives. Under this agreement, the terms and conditions for\nderivative products purchased or sold by the Group are unified. As part of the master agreement, a credit support\nannex (CSA) has also been signed. The CSA allows the Group to receive improved pricing by way of exchange of mark\nto market amounts in cash as collateral whether in favor of the Bank or the counter party.\nFor commission rate swaps entered into with European counterparties, the Bank and the European counterparty both\ncomply with the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). EMIR is a body of European legislation for the\ncentral clearing and regulation of Over the Counter (OTC) derivatives. The regulation includes requirements for\nreporting of derivatives contracts and implementation of risk management standards, and establishes common rules for\ncentral counterparties and trade repositories. Accordingly, all such standardized OTC derivatives contracts are traded\non exchanges and cleared through a Central Counter Party (CCP) through netting arrangements and exchanges of\ncash to reduce counter party credit and liquidity risk.\n12.

As at December 31, 2024, the Group maintains a legal provision amounting to SAR 14\nmillion (2023: SAR 14 million) for legal proceedings outstanding against the Group.\nb) Capital commitments\nAs at December 31, 2024 the Group had capital commitments of SAR 827 million (2023: SAR 438 million) in respect\nof property and equipment purchases.\nc) Credit related commitments and contingencies\nThe primary purpose of these instruments is to ensure that funds are available to a customer as required.\nGuarantees and standby letters of credit, which represent irrecoverable assurances that the Group will make payments\nin the event that a customer cannot meet its obligations to third parties, carry the same credit risk as loans and\nadvances. Cash requirements under guarantees and standby letters of credit are considerably less than the amount of\nthe commitment because the Group does not generally expect the third party to draw funds under the agreement.\nDocumentary letters of credit, which are written undertakings by the Group on behalf of a customer authorising a third\nparty to draw drafts on the Group up to a stipulated amount under specific terms and conditions, are generally\ncollateralised by the underlying shipments of goods to which they relate, and therefore have significantly less risk.\nAcceptances comprise undertakings by the Group to pay bills of exchange drawn on customers. The Group expects\nmost acceptances to be presented before being reimbursed by the customers.\nCommitments to extend credit represent the unused portion of authorizations to extend credit, principally in the form of\nloans and advances, guarantees and letters of credit. With respect to credit risk on commitments to extend credit, the\nGroup is potentially exposed to a loss in an amount equal to the total unused commitments. However, the likely amount\nof loss, which cannot readily be quantified, is expected to be considerably less than the total unused commitment as\nmost commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards. The total\noutstanding commitments to extend credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, as many of these\ncommitments could expire or terminate without being funded.\nInternal Use"

The IOC is a management-level committee, which meets on a quarterly\nbasis to provide internal governance on and ensure that all incentive plans are properly balanced for risk and reflective\nof BSF\u2019s compensation philosophy, strategic objectives and business unit goals, and shares its recommendations with\nthe NRC.\nThe Board of Directors (the Board) of the Bank is responsible for the overall design and oversight of the remuneration\nsystem which promotes prudent risk-taking behaviours and business practices and accordingly has not delegated this\nresponsibility to senior management. The Board also ensures that an annual review of the remuneration (internally\nthrough Internal Audit or externally commissioned by a recognized firm) is carried out independently and without the\nintervention of senior management, where the review assesses the Bank\u2019s compliance with SAMA Banks\nRemuneration Rules and any relevant laws, regulations, principles and standards, as well as the Bank\u2019s internal\npolicies that are prepared according to SAMA Banks Remuneration Rules. The Board takes into account the results of\nsuch a review when making decisions related to remuneration.\nThe Board is ultimately responsible for promoting effective governance, sound remuneration practices, ethical\nbehaviour and compliance with laws, regulations, and internal conduct standards, and for ensuring accountability for\nmisconduct; in addition to the following:\na) Overseeing and holding senior management accountable for implementing and participating in the design of the\nremuneration system that effectively delineates how remuneration tools address misconduct risk or other\nimprudent risk-taking behaviour.\nb) Engaging actively with senior management, including challenging senior management\u2019s remuneration\nassessments and recommendations if warranted when serious or recurring misconduct occurs and ensure that\nroot cause analysis is performed, lessons learned are promulgated bank-wide and new policies are adopted, as\nnecessary, to prevent it from happening again."

Performance based Variable Remuneration comes in the following forms:\nIncentive Plan\nIncentive Plans are designed to drive sales / debt collection & recovery, but are also designed to ensure that the right\nbehaviours are also reinforced, and high-risk activities are minimized or mitigated.\nAnnual Bonus Plan\nThe bonus pool (or funding) takes into account the net income of the Bank, where the size of the bonus pool\nrelatively grows in successful years, and is reduced in unsuccessful years where the Bank fails to meet its net\nincome target.\nThe bonus pool\u2019s distribution takes into account the job role, individual performance, group/division performance, and\nbank-wide performance.\nThe bonuses of employees classified as Senior Management or Material Risk Takers (MRTs) shall also be subject to\nBonus Deferral, where at least 40% of the annual performance bonus is deferred over 3 years, and where the\ndeferred amounts are converted to BSF Shares. Deferred bonuses are released in a phased manner, where a third\nof the deferred amount is released each subsequent year following the bonus cycle.\nLong Term Retention Plan\nThe Long Term Retention Plan (LTRP) aims to enhance the bank\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified\nmembers of the executive and senior management, as well as key and high potential employees, and to advance the\ninterests of the shareholders of the bank by providing these employees with equity ownership opportunities.\nThe bank\u2019s LTRP is a form of Restricted Stock Plan, where selected participants are allocated BSF shares that are\nsubject to a number of vesting conditions, including a minimum share retention period of 3 years (the shares\u2019 vesting\nperiod) and are also subject to the employee\u2019s continuous employment."

The Board has appointed the Board Risk Committee, which has the\nresponsibility to monitor the overall risk process within the Group.\nThe Risk Committee has the overall responsibility for the development of the risk strategy and implementing principles,\nframeworks, policies and limits.\nThe Risk Committee is responsible for managing risk decisions and monitoring risk levels and reports to the\nSupervisory Board.\nThe Group manages exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to\ndischarge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. Credit exposures arise principally in lending\nactivities that lead to loans and advances, and investment activities. There is also credit risk in off statement of financial\nposition financial instruments, such as loan commitments.\nThe Group assesses the probability of default of counterparties using internal rating tools with an overlay of credit\nassessment, where necessary. In addition, the Group also uses external ratings from major rating agencies where\navailable.\nThe Group attempts to control credit risk by monitoring credit exposures, limiting transactions with specific\ncounterparties, and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. The Group\u2019s risk management policies\nare designed to identify, to set appropriate risk limits and to monitor the risks and adherence to limits. Actual exposures\nagainst limits are monitored daily. In addition to monitoring credit limits, the Group manages the credit exposure relating\nto its trading activities by entering into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties in\nappropriate circumstances, and limiting the duration of exposure. In certain cases, the Group may also close out\ntransactions or assign them to other counterparties to mitigate credit risk. The Group\u2019s credit risk for derivatives\nrepresents the potential cost to replace the derivative contracts if counterparties fail to fulfill their obligation, and to\ncontrol the level of credit risk taken, the Group assesses counterparties using the same techniques as for its lending\nactivities.\nInternal Use"

Financial Risk Management (continued)\nThe following table sets out the credit analysis for trading financial assets measured at FVSI.\n2023\nSAR '000 2024\n(restated)\nInvestment securities\nInvestment grade 357,912 504,714\nTotal carrying amount 357,912 504,714\nd) Amounts arising from ECL \u2013 Significant increase in credit risk\nWhen determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial\nrecognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue\ncost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical\nexperience and expert credit assessment including forward-looking information.\nThe objective of the assessment is to identify whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred for an exposure\nby comparing:\n\u2022 change in significant increase in credit risk (SICR) from origination\n\u2022 days past due count\n\u2022 slippage in rating notches\nThe Group groups its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3 and POCI, as described below:\nStage 1: When loans are first recognised, the Group recognises an allowance based on 12 months ECLs. Stage 1\nloans also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been reclassified from Stage 2.\nStage 2: When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the Group records an allowance\nfor the Lifetime ECL. Stage 2 loans also include facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the loan has been\nreclassified from Stage 3.\nStage 3: Loans considered credit-impaired. The Group records an allowance for the Lifetime ECL.\nPOCI: Purchased or originated credit impaired (POCI) assets are financial assets that are credit impaired on initial\nrecognition. POCI assets are recorded at fair value at original recognition and interest income is subsequently\nrecognised based on a credit-adjusted EIR. ECLs are only recognised or released to the extent that there is a\nsubsequent change in the expected credit losses.\nDetermining whether credit risk has increased significantly\nThe criteria for determining whether credit risk has increased significantly vary by portfolio and include quantitative\nfactors like fall in ratings by one to five notches (depending on the portfolio) since credit origination along with\nqualitative factors, including a backstop based on delinquency.\nUsing its expert credit judgment and, where possible, relevant historical experience, the Group may determine that an\nexposure has undergone a significant increase in credit risk based on particular qualitative indicators that it considers\nare indicative of such and whose effect may not otherwise be fully reflected in its quantitative analysis on a timely basis.\nInternal Use"

Financial Risk Management (continued)\nSuch qualitative indicators include forbearance, covenant breaches and deterioration in credit quality of guarantors.\nAs a backstop, the Group considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an asset is more\nthan 30 days past due. Days past due are determined by counting the number of days since the earliest elapsed due\ndate in respect of which full payment has not been received. Due dates are determined without considering any grace\nperiod that might be available to the borrower.\nThe Group monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify significant increases in credit risk by regular\nreviews to confirm that:\n\u2022 the criteria are capable of identifying significant increases in credit risk before an exposure is in default;\n\u2022 the criteria do not align with the point in time when an asset becomes 30 days past due; and\n\u2022 there is no unwarranted volatility in loss allowance from transfers between 12-month PD (stage 1) and lifetime PD\n(stage 2).\nCredit risk grades\nThe Group allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on a variety of data that is determined to be predictive\nof the risk of default and applying experienced credit judgment. Credit risk grades are defined using qualitative and\nquantitative factors that are indicative of risk of default. These factors vary depending on the nature of the exposure\nand the type of borrower.\nCredit risk grades are defined and calibrated such that the risk of default occurring increases exponentially as the credit\nrisk deteriorates so, for example, the difference in risk of default between credit risk grades 1 and 2 is smaller than the\ndifference between credit risk grades 2 and 3.\nEach corporate exposure is allocated to a credit risk grade at initial recognition based on available information about\nthe borrower. Exposures are subject to ongoing monitoring, which may result in an exposure being moved to a different\ncredit risk grade. The monitoring of exposures involves use of the following data.\nCorporate exposures Retail exposures All exposures\n\u2022 Information obtained during periodic review \u2022 Internally collected data and \u2022 Payment record \u2013 this\nof customer files \u2013 e.g. audited financial customer behavior \u2013 e.g. includes overdue status as\nstatements, management accounts, utilization of credit card well as a range of variables\nbudgets and projections.

Financial Risk Management (continued)\ni) Generating the term structure of PD\nCredit Risk grades mapped to probabilities, Credit transition probabilities and Macroeconomic inputs determine the\nterm structure of Probability of Default. The Group collects performance and default information about its credit risk\nexposures analyzed by type of product and borrower as well as by credit risk grading. For some portfolios, information\nderived from external credit reference agencies is also used.\nThe Group employs analytical models to analyze the data collected and generate estimates of the remaining lifetime\nPD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result of the passage of time.\nThis analysis includes the identification and calibration of relationships between changes in default rates and macro-\neconomic factors as well as in-depth analysis of the impact of certain other factors (e.g. forbearance experience) on the\nrisk of default. Forward looking predictions of key macro-economic indicators e.g. GDP growth, inflation, unemployment\nor CDS spreads are translated analytically into the impact on Risk Factors, especially PD. For most of corporate\nportfolio exposures, key macro-economic indicators include: Government debt to GDP ratio, expectation of stock\nmarket return / volatility and interest rate forecast. While for retail portfolio, key macro-economic indicators include:\nunemployment rate, export of goods and services and banking claims on private sector.\nBased on advice from the Group\u2019s Classification and Impairment Committee and economic experts and consideration\nof a variety of external actual and forecast information, the Group formulates a 'base case' view of the future direction\nof relevant economic variables as well as a representative range of other possible forecast scenarios (see discussion\nbelow on incorporation of forward-looking information). The Group then uses these forecasts to adjust its estimates of\nPDs.\nii) Definition of \u2018Default\u2019\nThe Group considers a financial asset to be in default when:\n\u2022 the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to\nactions such as realizing security (if any is held); or\n\u2022 the borrower, is classified as non performing, or is past due more than 90 days on any material credit\nobligation to the Group. Overdrafts are considered as being past due once the customer has breached an\nadvised limit or been advised of a limit smaller than the current amount outstanding. In exceptional cases, this\ncriteria may be rebutted based on reasonable and supportable information (e.g. administrative oversight, delay\nin receipt of receivables from entities with strong credit standing) after following a rigorous review and\ngovernance process.\nIn assessing whether a borrower is in default. The Group considers indicators that are:\n\u2022 qualitative e.g. breaches of covenant;\n\u2022 quantitative e.g. overdue status and non-payment on another obligation of the same issuer to the Group; and\n\u2022 based on data developed internally and obtained from external sources.\nInputs into the assessment of whether a financial instrument is in default and their significance may vary over time to\nreflect changes in circumstances.\nThe definition of default largely aligns with that applied by the Group for regulatory capital purposes."

Financial Risk Management (continued)\niii) Modified financial assets\nThe contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions,\ncustomer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the customer. An existing\nloan whose terms have been modified may be derecognized and the renegotiated loan recognized as a new loan at fair\nvalue in accordance with the accounting policy.\nThe Group computes the gross carrying amounts using Cash flows for both the pre-modified Terms and post-\nmodification terms with original Interest Rate as EIR. If the difference in the gross carrying amounts is significant, the\nasset will be de-recognised and will be re-recognised as POCI (assuming that the modification is being undertaken in\nconnection with forbearance or a defaulted exposure).\nWhen the terms of a financial asset are modified and the modification does not result in de-recognition, the\ndetermination of whether the asset's credit risk has increased significantly reflects comparison of:\n\u2022 rating as at reporting date and the modified terms;\n\u2022 rating at initial origination and the original contract terms\nFor financial assets modified as part of the Group's forbearance policy, the estimate of PD reflects whether the\nmodification has improved or restored the Group's ability to collect special commission income and principal and the\nGroup's previous experience of similar forbearance action. As part of this process, the Group evaluates the borrower's\npayment performance against the modified contractual terms and considers various behavioral indicators.\nGenerally, forbearance is a qualitative indicator of a significant increase in credit risk and an expectation of forbearance\nmay constitute evidence that an exposure is credit-impaired/ in default. After classification as credit-impaired, the\ncustomer should demonstrate good payment behavior for at least a period of twelve months, prior to being considered\nfor upgrade.\nWhen modification results in derecognition, a new loan is recognised and allocated to Stage 1 (assuming it is not credit-\nimpaired at that time).\nThe Group renegotiates loans to customers in financial difficulties (referred to as 'forbearance activities' to maximize\ncollection opportunities and minimize the risk of default. Under the Group's forbearance policy, loan forbearance is\ngranted on a selective basis if the debtor is currently in default on its debt or if there is a high risk of default, there is\nevidence that the debtor made all reasonable efforts to pay under the original contractual terms and the debtor is\nexpected to be able to meet the revised terms.\nThe revised terms may include granting concession in interest rate and amending the terms of loan covenants. Both\nretail and corporate loans are subject to the forbearance policy. The Group Credit Committee regularly reviews reports\non forbearance activities.\nFrom a risk management point of view, once an asset is forborne or modified due to financial difficulties of the\nborrower, the Group\u2019s special department for distressed assets continues to monitor the exposure until it exits\nforbearance, i.e., it is either cured or completely and ultimately derecognised.\nInternal Use"

This process involves developing two or more\nadditional economic scenarios and considering the relative probabilities of each outcome. External information includes\neconomic data and forecasts published by governmental bodies and monetary authorities in the Kingdom and selected\nprivate sector and academic forecasters.\nThe base case represents a most-likely outcome and is aligned with information used by the Group for other purposes\nsuch as strategic planning and budgeting. The other scenarios represent more optimistic and more pessimistic\noutcomes. Periodically, the Group carries out stress testing of more extreme shocks to calibrate its determination of\nthese other representative scenarios.\nThe Group has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each portfolio of financial\ninstruments and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macro-economic variables\nand credit risk and losses.

Financial Risk Management (continued)\nPD estimates are estimates at a certain date, which are calculated based on analytical rating models, and assessed\nusing rating tools tailored to the various categories of counterparties and exposures. These analytical models are\nbased on internally and externally compiled data comprising both quantitative and qualitative factors. Where it is\navailable, market data may also be used to derive the PD for large corporate counterparties. If a counterparty or\nexposure migrates between ratings classes, then this will lead to a change in the estimate of the associated PD. PD\u2019s\nare estimated considering the contractual maturities of exposures.\nLGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Group estimates LGD parameters based on the history\nof recovery rates of claims against defaulted counterparties. The LGD models consider the structure, collateral,\nseniority of the claim and recovery costs of any collateral that is integral to the financial asset. The estimates are also\nsensitive to forward looking macroeconomic information.\nEAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Group derives the EAD from the current exposure\nto the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract including amortization. The\nEAD of a financial asset is its gross carrying amount. For lending commitments and financial guarantees, the EAD\nincludes the amount drawn, as well as potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are\nestimated based on historical observations and forward-looking forecasts or Regulatory guidelines. For some financial\nassets, EAD is determined by modeling the range of possible exposure outcomes at various points in time using\nscenario and statistical techniques.\nAs described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for financial assets for which credit risk has not\nsignificantly increased, the Group measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period\n(including any borrower's extension options for indeterminate maturity products) over which it is exposed to credit risk,\neven if, for risk management purposes, the Group considers a longer period. The maximum contractual period extends\nto the date at which the Group has the right to require repayment of an advance or terminate a loan commitment or\nguarantee.\nHowever, for retail overdrafts and credit card facilities that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment\ncomponent, the Group measures ECL over a period longer than the maximum contractual period if the Group's\ncontractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the Group's exposure to\ncredit losses to the contractual notice period. These facilities do not have a fixed term or repayment structure and are\nmanaged on a collective basis. The Group can cancel them with immediate effect but this contractual right is not\nenforced in the normal day-to-day management but only when the Group becomes aware of an increase in credit risk\nat the facility level. This longer period is estimated taking into account the credit risk management actions that the\nGroup expects to take and that serve to mitigate ECL. These include a reduction in limits, cancellation of the facility\nand/or turning the outstanding balance into a loan with fixed repayment terms.\nSensitivity of ECL allowance:\nThe table below illustrates the sensitivity of ECL to key factors used in determining it as at the year end:\nInternal Use"

Financial Risk Management (continued)\nf) Collateral\nThe Group in the ordinary course of lending activities hold collaterals as security to mitigate credit risk in loans and\nadvances. These collaterals mostly include time, demand, other cash deposits, financial guarantees, local and\ninternational equities, real estate and other fixed assets. The collaterals are held mainly against commercial and\nconsumer loans and are managed against relevant exposures at their net realizable values. For financial assets that\nare credit impaired at the reporting period, quantitative information about the collateral held as security is needed to the\nextent that such collateral mitigates credit risk.\nThe amount of collateral held (excluding the effect of overcollateralization) as security for loans that are credit-impaired\nas at December 31, are as follows:\nSAR '000 2024 2023\nCollateral coverage - less than 50% 1,424,467 1,416,637\nCollateral coverage \u2013 51% to 70% 46,744 -\nCollateral coverage - more than 70% 463,288 504,144\nTotal 1,934,499 1,920,781\n34. Market Risk\nMarket Risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in\nmarket variables such as Interest rates, Foreign Exchange rates and Equity prices. The Group classifies Market Risk\nexposures into either Trading or non-trading or Banking Book.\nMarket Risk within Trading & Banking Book is managed and monitored using various indicators such as Value at Risk,\nStress Testing and Sensitivities analysis.\na) Market Risk - Trading book\nThe Board has set limits for the acceptable level of risks in managing the Trading Book. In order to manage the Market\nRisk in Trading Book, the Group applies on a daily basis a VaR methodology in order to assess the Market Risk\npositions held and also to estimate the potential economic loss based on a set of assumptions and changes in market\nconditions.\nA VaR methodology estimates the potential negative change in market value of a portfolio at a given confidence level\nand over a specified time horizon. The Group uses simulation models to assess the possible changes in the market\nvalue of the trading book based on historical data. VaR models are usually designed to measure the market risk in a\nnormal market environment and therefore the use of VaR has limitations because it is based on historical correlations\nand volatilities in market prices and assumes that the future movements will follow a statistical distribution.\nThe VaR that the Group measures is an estimate, using a confidence level of 99% of the potential loss that is not\nexpected to be exceeded if the current market positions were to be held unchanged for one day. The use of 99%\nconfidence level depicts that within a one-day horizon, losses exceeding VaR figure should occur, on average, not\nmore than once every hundred days. A specific process of daily VaR back testing is performed to identify any\nexception.\nInternal Use"

Market Risk (continued)\nThe VaR represents the risk of portfolios at the close of a business day, and it does not account for any losses that may\noccur beyond the defined confidence interval. The actual trading results however, may differ from the VaR calculations\nand, in particular, the calculation does not provide a meaningful indication of profits and losses in stressed market\nconditions.\nTo overcome the VaR limitations mentioned above, the Group also carries out Stress tests of its portfolio to simulate\nconditions outside normal confidence intervals. The potential losses occurring under Stress test conditions are reported\nregularly to the Group's ALM and Market Risk committees for their review.\nThe Group\u2019s VaR related information for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are follows:\nSpecial\nForeign exchange Overall Trading\nSAR '000 commission rate\nrate\nrisk\n2024\nVaR as at December 31, 2024 48 3,695 3,742\nAverage VaR for 2024 211 4,053 4,263\nMaximum VaR for 2024 965 8,306 8,818\nMinimum VaR for 2024 9 1,996 2,093\n2023\nVaR as at December 31, 2023 75 4,781 4,935\nAverage VaR for 2023 122 5,806 5,892\nMaximum VaR for 2023 524 10,833 10,860\nMinimum VaR for 2023 5 1,972 2,195\nOverall Trading VaR incorporates compensation effect of positions coming from realized P&L in foreign currencies.\nb) Market risk non- trading book\nMarket risk on non-trading book mainly arises from the special commission rate, foreign currency exposures and\nequity price changes.\ni) Special commission rate risk\nSpecial commission rate risk arises from the possibility that the changes in special commission rates will affect either\nthe fair values or the future cash flows of the financial instruments. The Board has established special commission\nrate gap limits for stipulated periods. The Group monitors positions daily and uses hedging strategies to ensure\nmaintenance of positions within the established gap limits.\nThe following table depicts the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change in special commission rates, with other\nvariables held constant, on the Group\u2019s consolidated statement of income or equity. The sensitivity of the special\ncommission income is the effect of the assumed changes in special commission rates with a lowest level at 0%, on the\nnet special commission income for one year, based on the floating rate non-trading financial assets and financial\nliabilities held as at December 31, 2024 and 2023, including the effect of hedging instruments. The sensitivity of equity\nis calculated by revaluing the fixed rate FVOCI financial assets, including the effect of any associated hedges as at\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023 for the effect of assumed changes in special commission rate. The sensitivity of equity\nis analyzed by maturity of the asset or swap. All the banking book exposures are monitored and analyzed in currency\nconcentrations and relevant sensitivities are disclosed in SAR thousands.\nInternal Use"

Liquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its net funding requirements. Liquidity risk can be caused\nby market disruptions or credit downgrades, which may cause certain sources of funding to become unavailable\nimmediately. To mitigate this risk, management has diversified funding sources and assets are managed with liquidity\nin mind, maintaining an appropriate balance of cash, cash equivalents, and readily marketable securities.\nThe daily liquidity position is monitored and regular liquidity stress testing is conducted under a variety of scenarios\ncovering both normal and more severe market conditions. All liquidity policies and procedures are subject to review and\napproval by ALCO. Daily reports cover the liquidity position of both the Group and operating subsidiaries. A summary\nreport, including any exceptions and remedial action taken, is submitted regularly to ALCO.\nIn accordance with the Banking Control Law and the Regulations issued by SAMA, the Bank maintains a statutory\ndeposit with SAMA equal to 7% of total customers\u2019 demand deposits, and 4% of due to banks and other financial\ninstitutions (excluding balances due to SAMA and non-resident foreign currency deposits), saving deposits, time\ndeposits, margins of letters of credit and guarantee, excluding all type of repo deposits. In addition to the statutory\ndeposit, the Bank also maintains liquid reserves of not less than 20% of its deposit liabilities, in the form of cash, Saudi\nGovernment securities or assets which can be converted into cash within a period not exceeding 30 days. The Bank\ncan also raise additional funds through repo facilities available with SAMA against its holding of Saudi Government\nsecurities.\na) Maturity analysis of assets and liabilities\nThe following table summarizes the maturity profile of the Group\u2019s assets and liabilities. The expected maturities of\nassets and liabilities have been determined on the basis of the remaining period at the reporting date to the final\ncontractual maturity date and do not take into account the effective maturities as indicated by the Group\u2019s deposit\nretention history. Management monitors the maturity profile to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained. For\npresentation purposes all demand, saving and other deposit balances have been shown in no fixed maturity. These\ndemand deposit balances are payable on demand.\nInternal Use"

Fair values of financial assets and liabilities\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that\nthe transaction takes place either:\n\u2022 in the accessible principal market for the asset or liability, or\n\u2022 in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantages accessible market for the asset or liability\nThe fair values of on statement of financial position financial instruments are not significantly different from their\ncarrying amounts included in the consolidated financial statements.\nFor financial instruments that trade infrequently and have little price transparency, fair value is less objective, and\nrequires varying degrees of judgment depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty of market factors, pricing\nassumptions and other risks affecting the specific instrument.\nValuation models\nValuation techniques include net present value and discounted cash flow models, comparison with similar instruments\nfor which market observable prices exist. Assumptions and inputs used in valuation techniques include risk-free and\nbenchmark interest rates, credit spreads and other premium used in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices\nand foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe objective of the valuation techniques is to arrive at a fair value measurement that reflects the price that would be\nreceived to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. The Group uses widely recognized valuation models for determining the fair value of common and\nsimpler financial instruments.\nObservable prices or model inputs are usually available in the market for listed debt and equity securities, exchange-\ntraded derivatives and simple over-the-counter derivatives such as interest rate swaps. Availability of observable\nmarket prices and model inputs reduces the need for management judgment and estimation and also reduces the\nuncertainty associated with determining fair values. Availability of observable market prices and inputs varies\ndepending on the products and markets and is prone to changes based on specific events and general conditions in\nthe financial markets.\nValuation models that employ significant unobservable inputs require a higher degree of management judgment and\nestimation in the determination of fair value. Management judgment and estimation are usually required for selection of\nthe appropriate valuation model to be used, determination of expected future cash flows on the financial instrument\nbeing valued, determination of the probability of counterparty default and prepayments and selection of appropriate\ndiscount rates. Fair value estimates obtained from models are adjusted for any other factors, such as liquidity risk or\nmodel uncertainties; to the extent that the Group believes that a third party market participant would take them into\naccount in pricing a transaction. Fair value aims also to reflect the credit risk of the instrument and include adjustments\nto take account of the credit risk of the Group and the counterparty where appropriate.\nValuation Framework\nThe Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. This framework\nincludes a Market Risk Department, which is independent of Front Office management and reports to the Chief Risk\nOfficer, and which has overall responsibility for independently verifying the results of trading and investment operations\nand all significant fair value measurements. Specific controls include:\nInternal Use"

Fair values of financial assets and liabilities (continued)\nDuring the year, there have been no transfers in between level 1, level 2 and level 3.\nThe following table shows a reconciliation from the beginning balances to the ending balances for the fair value\nmeasurements in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy:\nFinancial investments classified as FVOCI\nSAR '000 2024 2023\nBalance at the beginning of the year 210,417 210,353\nTransfer from level 2 - -\nAdditions during the year 107,503 6,247\nDisposal during the year (9,000) -\nChange in the value (9,241) (6,183)\nBalance at the end of the year 299,679 210,417\nLevel 3 investment instruments include private equity portfolio of SAR 7 million (2023: SAR 16 million) which has been\nvalued at cost as their market value is not significantly different from the carrying values. The remaining level 3\nportfolio of SAR 293 million (2023: SAR 194 million) invested in funds which were valued based on the valuation\ntechniques using their latest financial statements. The acquisition value of those funds was SAR 309 million (2023:\nSAR 202 million).\nThe fair values of on-statement of financial position financial instruments, except for loans and advances and financial\ninstruments held at amortized cost are not significantly different from the carrying values included in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. The fair values of commission bearing customers\u2019 deposits, debt securities, due from and due to\nbanks which are carried at amortized cost, are not significantly different from the carrying values included in the\nconsolidated financial statements, since the current market commission rates for similar financial instruments are not\nsignificantly different from the contracted rates, and due to the short duration of due from and due to banks. An active\nmarket for these instruments is not available and the Bank intends to realize the carrying value of these financial\ninstruments through settlement with the counter party at the time of their respective maturities.\nThe estimated fair values of the investments held at amortized cost are based on quoted market prices when available\nor pricing models when used in case of bonds. Consequently, differences can arise between carrying values and fair\nvalue estimates. The fair values of derivatives are based on the quoted market prices when available or by using the\nappropriate valuation technique.\nDerivative products valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs are mainly commission rate\nswaps and options, currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied valuation\ntechniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations. The models incorporate\nvarious inputs including foreign exchange spot and forward rates and commission rate curves. Other investments in\nlevel 2 are valued based on market observable date including broker rates etc.\nThe fair values of investments held at amortized cost are SAR 26,098 million (2023: SAR 23,988 million) against\ncarrying value of SAR 27,678 million (2023: SAR 24,640 million). It includes level 1 investment amounting to SAR\n2,059 million (2023: SAR 2,149 million), level 2 investment amounting to SAR 23,400 million (2023: SAR 21,291\nmillion) and level 3 investment amounting to SAR 639 million (2023: SAR 548 million).\nThe Group uses the discounted cash flow method using current yield curve to arrive at the fair value of loans and\nadvances (level 3 instruments) after adjusting internal credit spread which is SAR 205,276 million (2023: SAR 179,455\nmillion). The carrying values of those loans and advances are SAR 204,168 million (2023: SAR 179,391 million).\nInternal Use"

Climate Related Risk\nThe relevance and urgency of climate change, and its associated financial impact, have rapidly risen up companies\u2019\nagendas over the past few years due to the increasingly prevalent risks over the short, medium, and long-term\nhorizons. Addressing and mitigating climate change is a complex challenge, and one in which the banking sector will\nplay a central role.\nThe banking sector will be increasingly impacted by climate risk through accelerating stakeholder expectations,\nregulatory development, and market pressures. Banks are exposed to climate-related risks through their lending and\ninvestment activities, which can be susceptible to heightened climate-sensitive sectors and assets.\nTherefore, it is vital that BSF fully identify, assess and manage its climate-related risks and their impact on the Group\u2019s\nprincipal risk categories, such as credit risk, reputational risk, and liquidity risk. BSF will achieve this by categorizing the\ncrucial physical and transitional risks that may impact the business.\nPhysical risks\nPhysical risks are weather events and longer-term shifts in climate that are driven by climate change. These can be\nacute events, such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, or chronic changes that result in sea level rise, increased ambient\ntemperatures, and desertification. The nature, severity, and timing of extreme weather events are uncertain, but\nglobally we are seeing a surge in their frequency and the impact on economies is becoming increasingly evident.\nPhysical risks may impact a business through damage to property, stranded assets, and supply chain disruption.\nTransitional risks\nAs countries commit to transitioning to a low-carbon economy around the globe, there are significant financial risks\nassociated with this shift, which can depend on the nature, speed, uptake and significance of changes imposed.\nTransition risks can include accelerating regulatory expectations, technology advancements, reputational damage and\nmarket risks.\nAlthough climate change presents challenges to BSF and the broader banking sector, there are also significant\nopportunities for the Group to capitalize upon. The transition to a low-carbon economy will require new products and\nservices (such as green and climate bonds), increased resource efficiency will lead to cost savings and access to new\nmarkets.\nBSF will extend its comprehensive risk management processes to embed climate-related risks within its core\nprocedures. As part of future climate risks assessments, BSF will consider the following to measure, manage and\nmonitor climate-related risks within the business:\n\u2022 The key sectors and areas of business that will be impacted by climate change\n\u2022 Associating and estimating the financial impact of the identified risks\n\u2022 Possible mitigation measures the Group can implement\nBSF recognizes this is an evolving subject and will require the Group to work holistically to contribute to its complexity.\nA better fundamental understanding of these risks will allow the Group to make more informed financial decisions and\nengage with stakeholders more effectively on the topic."

The\ncertificates mature on January 21, 2030.\n45. Restatement\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, management identified equity investments in which the Bank held\ninterest, in prior years. These were not recorded in the prior year\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Upon identifying\nthese equity investments, management decided to classify this as fair value through profit or loss and sold these\ninvestments during Q4 2024. Consequently, the Bank\u2019s investments and retained earning balances were understated\nas of December 31, 2023 and as of January 01, 2023.

Further, the Bank has not\npresented the consolidated statement of financial position as of January 01, 2023, as the impact was insignificant on\nthe consolidated statement of financial position as of this date. On disposal of these investments, the Bank has\nrecognized a gain of SAR 296 million in the current year\u2019s consolidated statement of income.\n46.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\ne) Impairment (continued)\nMeasurement of ECL\nECL is a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:\n- financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference\nbetween the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive);\n- financialassetsthatarecredit-impairedatthereportingdate:asthedifferencebetweenthegrosscarryingamountandthepresent\nvalue of estimated future cash flows;\n- undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Group if\nthe commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive; and\n- financial guarantee contracts: the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Group expects to recover.\nWhen discounting future cash flows, the following discount rates are used:\n- financial assets: the original effective interest rate or an approximation thereof;\n-undrawnloancommitments:theeffectiveinterestrate,oranapproximationthereof,thatwillbeappliedtothefinancialassetresulting\nfrom the loan commitment; and\n- financial Guarantee contracts issued: the rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks\nthat are specific to the cash flows.\nRestructured financial assets\nIfthetermsof afinancial assetare renegotiatedor modifiedor anexisting financialasset isreplaced witha newone dueto financial\ndifficultiesoftheborrower,thenanassessmentismadeofwhetherthefinancialassetshouldbederecognizedandECLaremeasured\nas follows:\n- If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, and then the expected cash flows arising from the\nmodified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset.\n-Iftheexpectedrestructuringwillresultinderecognitionoftheexistingasset,thentheexpectedfairvalueofthenewassetistreated\nasthefinalcashflowfromtheexistingfinancialassetat thetimeofitsderecognition.Thisamountisincludedincalculatingthecash\nshortfallsfromtheexistingfinancialassetthatarediscountedfromtheexpected dateof derecognitionto thereporting dateusing the\noriginal effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.\nCredit-impaired financial assets\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt financial assets carried at\nFVOCI, are credit-impaired. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have detrimental impact on the\nestimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.\nEvidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;\n- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;\n- the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Bank on terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise ;\n- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; or\n- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\nA loan that has been renegotiated due to deterioration in the borrower's condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless\nthere is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of\nimpairment.\nIn making an assessment of whether an investment in sovereign debt is credit-impaired, the Group considers the following factors.\n- The market's assessment of creditworthiness as reflected in the bond yields.\n- The rating agencies' assessments of creditworthiness.\n- The country's ability to access the capital markets for new debt issuance.\n- The probability of debt being restructured, resulting in holders suffering losses through voluntary or mandatory debt forgiveness.\n- The international support mechanisms in place to provide the necessary support as 'lender of last resort' to thatcountry, aswell as\ntheintention,reflectedinpublicstatements,ofgovernmentsandagenciestousethosemechanisms.Thisincludesanassessmentof\nthe depth of those mechanisms and, irrespective of the political intent, whether there is the capacity to fulfil the required criteria.\nPage 17 of 95"

However, some collateral, for example, cash or\nsecurities relating to margining requirements, is valued daily. To the extent possible, the Bank uses active market data for valuing financial\nassets heldas collateral. Otherfinancialassets whichdonot havereadily determinablemarket values arevaluedusingmodels. Non-financial\ncollateral, such as real estate, is valued based on data provided by third parties such as mortgage brokers, or based on housing price indices.\nCollateral repossessed\nThe Bank\u2019s policy is to determine whether a repossessed asset can be best used for its internal operations or should be sold.\nAssets determined to be useful for the internal operations, if any, are transferred to their relevant asset category at the fair value, if material.\nAssetsforwhichsellingisdeterminedtobeabetteroptionaretransferredtoassetsheldforsaleattheirfairvalue(iffinancialassets)andfair\nvalue less cost to sell for non-financial assets at the repossession date in, line with the Bank\u2019s policy.\nInits normalcourseof business, theBank does not physically repossess properties orotherassets inits retailportfolio, but engages external\nagents torecoverfunds, generally at auction, tosettleoutstandingdebt. Any surplus funds arereturnedtothecustomers/obligors. As aresult\nof this practice, the residential properties under legal repossession processes are not recorded on the Statement of financial position.\nWrite-off\nLoans and debt securities are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery.

Subsequent to the initial recognition, the Group's liability under each guarantee is measured at the higher of\nthe amortised amount and the best estimate of expenditure required to settle any financial obligations arising as a result of\nguarantees. Any increase in the liability relating to the financial guarantee is taken to the consolidated statement of income in\n'impairment charge for credit losses'.

The benefit of a government deposit at a below-market rate of profit is\ntreated as a government grant related to income. The below-market rate deposit is recognised and measured in accordance with\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments. The benefit of the below-market rate of interest is measured as the difference between the initial fair\nvalue of the deposit determined in accordance with IFRS 9 and the proceeds received. The benefit is accounted for in accordance\nwith IAS 20. The government grant is recognised in the consolidated statement of income on a systematic basis over the period in\nwhich the bank recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grant is intended to compensate. The grant income is only\nrecognised when the ultimate beneficiary is the Bank.\nh) Revenue / expenses recognition\nSpecial commission income and expenses\nSpecial commission income and expense are recognized in statement of income, using the effective interest method. The 'effective\ninterest rate' is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial\ninstrument to the gross carrying amount of the financial instrument.\nWhen calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than credit-impaired assets, the Group estimates future\ncash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not expected credit losses. For credit-impaired financial\nassets, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated using estimated future cash flows including expected credit losses.\nThecalculationoftheeffectiveinterestrateincludestransactioncostsand feesand pointspaid orreceived thatare anintegral part\nofthe effectiveinterest rate.Transaction costsinclude incrementalcosts thatare directlyattributable tothe acquisitionor issueof a\nfinancial asset or financial liability.\nPage 19 of 95"

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)\nh) Revenue / expenses recognition (continued)\nMeasurement of amortized cost and special commission income\nThe 'amortised cost' of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is\nmeasured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective\ninterest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any\nexpected credit loss allowance.\nThe 'gross carrying amount of a financial asset' is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for anyexpected credit\nlossallowance.Incalculatinginterestincomeandexpense,theeffectiveinterestrateisappliedtothegrosscarryingamountofthe\nasset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability.\nHowever, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by\napplying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the\ncalculationofinterestincomerevertstothegrossbasis.Forfinancialassetsthatwerecredit-impairedoninitialrecognition,interest\nincome is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the asset. The calculation of\ninterest income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves.\nFee and commission income\nFee and commissions are recognised when the service has been provided. Loan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be\ndrawn down are deferred, together with the related direct cost, and are recognised as an adjustment to the effective yield on the\nloan. When a loan commitment is not expected to result in the draw-down of a loan, loan commitment fees are recognised on a\nstraight-line basis over the commitment period. Portfolio and other management advisory and service fees are recognised based\non the applicable service contracts, usually on a time-proportionate basis. Fee received on asset management, wealth\nmanagement,financialplanning,custodyservicesandothersimilarservicesthatareprovidedoveranextendedperiodoftime,are\nrecognised over the period when the service is being provided.\nOthers\nDividend income is recognised when the Group's right to receive payment is established.

The Group attributes the revenue from management fees to the\nservices provided during the period, because the fee relates specifically to the Group\u2019s efforts to transfer the services for that\nperiod.

The Group\u2019s share of profit of an associate is shown on the face of the consolidated statement of income.\nl) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\nAs permitted by IFRS 9, the Group has elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39.\nDerivativefinancialinstruments,includingforeignexchangecontracts,specialcommissionrateswapsandcurrencyoptions(bothwritten\nand purchased), are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into, with transaction costs\nrecognised in the consolidated statement of income and, are subsequently re-measured at fair value. All derivatives are carried at their\nfair value as assets where the fair value is positive and as liabilities where the fair value is negative. Fair values are obtained by reference\nto quoted market prices, discounted cash flow models and pricing models, as appropriate. The treatment of changes in their fair value\ndepends on their classification into the following categories:\ni) Derivatives held for trading\nAny changes in the fair value of derivatives that are held for trading purposes are taken directly to the consolidated statement of\nincome and disclosed in trading income/ loss. Derivatives held for trading also include those derivatives, which do not qualify for\nhedge accounting described below.\nii) Hedge accounting\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in qualifying hedging relationships.\nFor the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified into two categories: (a) fair value hedges which hedge the exposure to\nchanges in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment or an identified portion of such an\nasset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect the reported net gain or loss; and (b) cash\nflow hedges which hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a\nrecognised asset or liability, or to a highly probable forecasted transaction that will affect the reported net gain or loss.\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge should be expected to be highly effective, i.e. the changes in fair value or cash\nflows of the hedging instrument should effectively offset corresponding changes in the hedged item, and should be reliably\nmeasurable.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n34.1 CREDIT RISK\nCredit exposures arise principally in lending activities (for both conventional and non-conventional banking products) that lead to\nloans and advances, and investment activities. There is also credit risk in off-balance sheet financial instruments, such as loan\ncommitments. The Group uses internal credit rating tools to assess credit standing of its counterparties and assigns credit ratings\naccordingly. Also the Group uses the external ratings, of the major rating agency, where applicable. A potential credit loss might\narise due to lack of proper credit analysis of the borrower's credit worthiness, inability to service the debt, lack of appropriate\ndocumentation, etc.\nThe Group attempts to control credit risk by deploying various credit risk management techniques and processes, such as,\napplication Risk Acceptance Criteria (RAC\u2019s) as credit risk screening tools, appropriate credit structuring, credit review process,\npost-disbursal monitoring of credit exposures, limiting transactions with specific counterparties, and continually assessing the\ncreditworthinessofcounterparties. TheGroup\u2019s riskmanagement policiesare designedto identifyand toset appropriaterisk limits\nand to monitor the risks and adherence to limits. Actual exposures against limits are monitored daily. In addition to monitoring\ncreditlimits,theGroupmanagesthecreditexposurerelatingtoitstradingactivitiesbyenteringintomasternettingagreementsand\ncollateralarrangementswithcounterpartiesinappropriatecircumstances,andlimitingthedurationofexposure.Incertaincases,the\nGroup may also close out transactions or assign them to other counterparties to mitigate credit risk.\nThe Group\u2019s credit risk for derivatives, represents the potential cost to replace the derivative contracts if counterparties failto fulfil\ntheirobligation,andtocontrolthelevelofcreditrisktaken,theGroupassessescounterpartiesusingthesametechniquesasforits\nlending activities.\nConcentrationRiskreferstotheriskfromanunevendistributionofcounterpartiesincreditorinotherbusinessrelationshiporfrom\nconcentration in business sectors or geographical regions. Accordingly, Concentration risk in the credit portfolios comes into\nexistence through a skewed distribution of financing to (a) individual borrower (name concentration) (b) industry /economic sector\n(sector concentration) and (c) geographical regions (regional concentration). Concentrations of credit risk indicate the relative\nsensitivity of the Group\u2019s performance to developments affecting any particular category of concentration.\nThe Group seeks to manage its credit risk exposure through diversification of lending activities to ensure that there is no undue\nconcentration of risks with individuals or groups of customers in specific locations or business. It also takes security when\nappropriate. The Group also seeks additional collateral from the counterparty as soon as impairment indicators are noticed for the\nrelevant individual loans and advances.\nManagement monitors the market value of collateral recurrently, requests additional collateral in accordance with the underlying\nagreement and monitors the market value of collateral obtained during its review of the adequacy of the allowance for impairment\nlosses.TheGroupregularlyreviewsitsriskmanagementpoliciesandsystemstoreflectchangesinmarketsproductsandemerging\nbest practice.\nThecreditqualityoftheGroup\u2019s financialassetsandlettersofcredit,lettersofguaranteeandacceptancesisdisclosedinnote34.3\na).

These factors vary depending on the nature of the exposure and the type of borrower and his\nbusiness activities.\nCredit risk grades are defined and calibrated such that the risk of default occurring increases exponentially as the credit risk\ndeteriorates so, for example, the difference in risk of default between credit risk grades 1 and 2 is smaller than the difference\nbetween credit risk grades 2 and 3.\nEach corporate exposure is allocated to a credit risk grade at initial recognition based on available information about the\nborrower. Exposures are subject to ongoing monitoring, which may result in an exposure being moved to a different credit risk\ngrade. The monitoring of exposures involves use of the following data:\nCorporate exposures Retail exposures All exposures\nInformation obtained during periodic review of Internallycollecteddataand customer Payment record \u2013 this includes\ncustomer files \u2013 e.g. audited financial behavior\u2013e.g.utilizationofcreditcard overdue status as well as a range\nstatements, management accounts, budgets facilities. of variables about payment ratios.\nand projections.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n34.3 CREDIT QUALITY ANALYSIS (continued)\nb) Amounts arising from ECL \u2013 Significant increase in credit risk (continued)\ni) Generating the term structure of PD\nCredit risk grades are a primary input into the determination of the term structure of PD for exposures. The Group collects\nperformance and default information about its credit risk exposures analyzed by type of product and borrower as well as by\ncredit risk grading. For some portfolios, information obtained from external credit reference agencies is also used.\nThe Group employs statistical models to analyze the data collected and generate estimates of the remaining lifetime PD of\nexposures and how these are expected to change as a result of the passage of time.\nThis analysis includes the identification and calibration of relationships between changes in default rates and macro-economic\nfactorsaswellasin-depthanalysisoftheimpactofcertainotherfactors(e.g.forbearanceexperience)ontheriskofdefault.For\nmost exposures, key macro-economic indicators include GDP growth, oil prices, inflation, and money supply. For exposures to\nspecific industries and/or regions, the analysis may extend to relevant commodity and/or real estate prices.\nBasedonadvicefromtheGroup'sChiefEconomistandconsiderationofavarietyofexternalactualandforecastinformation,the\nGroup formulates a 'base case' view of the future direction of relevant economic variables as well as a representative range of\nother possible forecast scenarios (see discussion below on incorporation of forward-looking information). The Group then uses\nthese forecasts to adjust its estimates of PDs.\nTheBankutilizesamasterratingscale consisting of23 ratinggrades. Ofwhich, thetop 20represent performinggrades, while\nthe bottom3 represent non-performing grades. The performinggrades arefurther bifurcatedinto 10Investment Gradesand 10\nNon-investment Grades. The Investment Grades from 1 \u2013 10 correspond to probabilities of default ranging from 0%to 0.48%,\nwhile the Non-investment Grades from 11 \u2013 20 correspond to probabilities of default in the range of 0.48% to 99.99%. Finally, the\n3 non-performing grades correspond to a probability of default of 100%\nii) Determining whether credit risk has increased significantly\nThe criteria for determining whether credit risk has increased significantly vary by portfolio and include quantitative changes in\ncredit risk grades, PDs, and qualitative factors, including a backstop based on delinquency.\nThecreditriskofaparticularexposureisdeemedtohaveincreased significantlysince initialrecognition if,Group's quantitative\nrisk grading and PDmodels indicate a material credit risk deterioration. In addition, using its expert credit judgment and, where\npossible, relevant historical experience, the Group may determines that an exposure has undergone a significant increase in\ncredit risk based on particular qualitative indicators that it considers are indicative of such, and whoseeffect maynot otherwise\nbe fully reflected in its quantitative analysis on a timely basis.\nAsabackstop,theGroupconsidersthatasignificantincreaseincreditriskoccursnolaterthanwhenanassetismorethan30\ndays past due, on a material exposure. Days past due are determined by counting the number of days since the due date in\nrespect of which full payment that is in excess of the materiality threshold has not been received. Due dates are determined\nwithout considering any grace period that might be available to the borrower.\nThe Group monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify significant increases in credit risk by regular reviews to\nconfirm that:\n- the criteria are capable of identifying significant increases in credit risk before an exposure is in default;\n- the criteria do not align with the point in time when an asset becomes 30 days past due; and\n- there is no unwarranted volatility in loss allowance from transfers between 12-month PD (stage 1) and lifetime PD (stage 2).\niii) Modified financial assets\nThe contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions, customer\nretention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the customer or being undergone into\nfinancially stressed conditions. An existing loan whose terms have been modified may be derecognized and the renegotiated\nloan recognized as a new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy.\nWhen the terms of a financial asset are modified and the modification does not result in de-recognition, the determination of\nwhethertheasset'screditriskhasincreasedsignificantlyreflectscomparisonofPDatthereportingdatebasedonthemodified\nterms and the PD estimated based on data at initial recognition and the original contractual terms.\nPage 73 of 95"

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n34.3 CREDIT QUALITY ANALYSIS (continued)\nb) Amounts arising from ECL \u2013 Significant increase in credit risk (continued)\niii) Modified financial assets (continued)\nThe Group renegotiates loans to customers in financial difficulties (referred to as 'forbearance activities') to maximize collection\nopportunities and minimize the risk of default. Under the Group's forbearance policy, loan forbearance is granted on a selective\nbasis if the debtor is currently in default on its debt or if there is ahigh riskof default,there isevidence thatthe debtormade all\nreasonable efforts to pay under the original contractual terms and the debtor is expected to be able to meet the revised terms.\nTherevisedtermsusuallyincludeextendingthematurity,changingthebankingcommission,thetimingofinterestpaymentsand\namending the terms of loan covenants. Both retail and corporate loans are subject to the forbearance policy.Therelevant Board\nCommittee regularly receives Loan Asset Quality review reports including forbearance activities.\nFor financial assets modified as part of the Group's forbearance policy, the estimate of PDreflects whether the modification has\nimproved or restored the Group's ability to collect interest and principal and the Group's previous experience of similar\nforbearance action. As part of this process, the Group evaluates the borrower's payment performance against the modified\ncontractual terms and considers various behavioral indicators.\nGenerally, forbearance is a qualitative indicator of a significant increase in credit risk and an expectation of forbearance may\nconstitute evidence that an exposure is credit-impaired /in default. A customerneeds todemonstrate consistentlygood payment\nbehavior over a period of time before the exposure is no longer considered to be credit-impaired/ in default or the PD is\nconsidered to have decreased such that the loss allowance reverts to being measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.\niv) Definition of \u2018Default\u2019\nThe Group considers a financial asset to be in default when:\n- the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as\nrealizing security (if any is held); or\n-theborrowerispastduemorethan90daysonany materialcredit obligationto theGroup. Overdraftsare consideredas being\npastdueoncethecustomerhasbreachedanadvisedlimitorbeenadvisedofalimitsmallerthanthecurrentamountoutstanding.\nIn assessing whether a borrower is in default. The Group considers indicators that are:\n- qualitative- e.g. breaches of covenant ;\n- quantitative- e.g. overdue status and non-payment on another obligation of the same issuer to the Group; and\n- based on data developed internally and obtained from external sources.\nInputs into the assessment of whether a financial instrument is in default and their significance may vary over time to reflect\nchanges in circumstances.\nPage 74 of 95"

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n34.3 CREDIT QUALITY ANALYSIS (continued)\nb) Amounts arising from ECL \u2013 Significant increase in credit risk (continued)\nvi) Measurement of ECL\nThe key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the term structure of the following factors:\ni. Probability of default (PD);\nii. Loss given default (LGD);\niii. Exposure at default (EAD).\nThese parameters are generally derived from internally developed statistical models and other historical data. They are adjusted to\nreflect forward-looking information as described above.\nPDestimatesareestimatesatacertaindate,whicharecalculatedbasedonstatisticalratingmodels,andassessedusingratingtools\ntailored to the various categories of counterparties and exposures. These statistical models are based on internally compiled data\ncomprising both quantitative and qualitative factors. Where it is available, market data may also be used to derive the PD for large\nnon-retail counterparties. If a counterparty or exposure migrates between ratings classes, then this will lead to a change in the\nestimate of the associated PD. PDs are estimated considering the contractual maturities of exposures.\nLGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Group estimates LGD parameters based on the history of recovery\nrates of claims against defaulted counterparties. The LGD models consider the structure, collateral, seniority of the claim,\ncounterparty industry and recovery costs of any collateral that is integral to the financial asset. LGD estimates are recalibrated for\ndifferent economic scenarios and calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using the effective interest rate as the discounting factor.\nEAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Group derives the EAD from the current exposure to the\ncounterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract including amortization. The EAD of a financial\nasset is its gross carrying amount. For lending commitments, financial guarantees and Retail credit cards, the EAD includes the\namount drawn, as well as potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated based on historical\nobservations and forward-looking forecasts. For some financial assets, EAD is determined by modeling the range of possible\nexposure outcomes at various points in time using scenario and statistical techniques.\nAsdescribedabove,andsubjecttousingamaximumofa12-monthPDforfinancialassetsforwhichcreditriskhasnotsignificantly\nincreased,theGroupmeasuresECLconsideringtheriskofdefaultoverthemaximumcontractualperiodoverwhichitisexposed to\ncreditrisk,evenif,forriskmanagementpurposes,theGroupconsidersalongerperiod.Themaximumcontractualperiodextendsto\nthe date at which the Group has the right to require repayment of an advance or terminate a loan commitment or guarantee.\nWhere modeling of a parameter is carried out on a collective basis, the financial instruments are banked on the basis ofshared risk\ncharacteristics that include but not limited to below:\n- Product / instrument type;\n- Credit risk categorization;\n- Collateral type;\n- Recovery and cure rates;\n- Date of initial recognition;\n- Remaining term to maturity;\n- Geographic location of the borrower;\n- Economic Sectors.\nThe Group's risk and business profile is subject to regular review to ensure that exposures within a particular Group remain\nappropriately homogeneous.\nFor portfolios in respect of which the Bank has limited historical data, external benchmark information is used to supplement the\ninternally available data.\nPage 78 of 95"

MARKET RISK\nMarketRiskistheriskthatthefairvalueorfuturecashflowsofthefinancialinstrumentswillfluctuateduetochangesinmarketvariables\nsuch as special commission rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity and equity prices. The Group classifies exposures to market risk\ninto either trading or non-trading/ banking-book. The market risk for the trading book is managed and monitored using a VaR\nmethodology. Market risk for the non-trading book is managed and monitored using a combination of VaR, stress testing and sensitivity\nanalysis.\n35.1 Market Risk - Trading Book\nTheGrouphassetlimits(bothVaRandexposurebasedlimits)fortheacceptablelevelofrisksinmanagingthetradingbook.Inorderto\nmanage the market risk in trading book, the Group applies a VaR methodology to assess the market risk positions held and also to\nestimate the potential economic loss based on a set of assumptions and changes in market conditions.\nAVaRmethodologyestimatesthepotentialnegativechangeinmarketvalueofaportfolioatagivenconfidencelevelandoveraspecified\ntimehorizon.TheGroupusesvariance-covarianceapproachforcalculatingVaRfortradingbookbasedonhistoricaldata(of1year).VaR\nmodels are usually designed to measure the market risk in a normal market environment and therefore the use of VaR has limitations\nbecause it is based on historical correlations and volatilities in market prices and assumes that the future movements will follow a\nstatistical distribution.\nThe Bank calculates VaR on the basis of the following:\n1. 10 days holding period at 99% confidence interval for regulatory capital computation\n2. 1 day holding period at 99% confidence interval for internal reporting and for disclosure purposes.\nThis means that the VaR that the Group measures is an estimate (using a confidence level of 99% of the potential loss) that is not\nexpected to be exceeded if the current market positions were to be held unchanged for 1 or 10 days. The use of 99%confidence level\ndepicts that within a 1-day horizon, losses exceeding VaR figure should occur, on average, not more than once every hundred days.\nTheVaRrepresentstheriskofportfoliosatthecloseofabusinessday,anditdoesnotaccountforanylossesthatmayoccurbeyondthe\ndefined confidence interval. The actual trading results however, may differ from the VaR calculations and, in particular, the calculation\ndoes not provide a meaningful indication of profits and losses in stressed market conditions.\nTo overcome the VaR limitations mentioned above, the Group also carries out stress tests of both non-trading and trading portfolios to\nsimulate conditions outside normal confidence intervals using six stress scenarios for the entire Group. The potential losses occurring\nunder stress test conditions are reported regularly to the Bank's Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) for their review.\nThe Group\u2019s VaR related information for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 using a 1 day holding period at 99%confidence\ninterval is set out below.

Basis of preparation\nReferences to the Bank hereafter in these consolidated financial statements refer to disclosures that are relevant only\nto the Bank and not collectively to the Group.\na) Statement of compliance\nThese consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 have been prepared\n\u2022 In accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and\nother standards and pronouncements issued by the Saudi Organization for Chartered and Professional\nAccountants (SOCPA); as collectively referred to IFRSs that are endorsed in KSA.\n\u2022 In compliance with the provisions of Banking Control Law, the Regulations for Companies in the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia and by-laws of the Bank.\nb) Basis of measurement and presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented under the historical cost convention except\nfor the measurement at fair value of financial assets held at fair value derivatives, financial assets held at fair\nvalue through income statement (FVIS), Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) - debt\ninstruments and equity instruments and defined benefit obligation. In addition, financial assets or liabilities that\nare carried at amortized cost but are hedged in a fair value hedging relationship are carried at fair value to the\nextent of the risk being hedged. The consolidated statement of financial position is broadly in order of liquidity.\nc) Functional and presentation currency\nThese consolidated financial statements are presented in Saudi Arabian Riyals (SAR) which is the Group\u2019s\nfunctional currency. Except as otherwise indicated, financial information presented in SAR has been rounded off\nto the nearest thousand.\nd) Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS as endorsed in KSA requires the\nuse of certain critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the\nGroup\u2019s accounting policies. Such judgements, estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are\nbased on historical experience and other factors, including obtaining professional advice and expectations of\nfuture events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nRevisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision\naffects only that period, or in the period of revision and in future periods if the revision affects both current and\nfuture periods. Significant areas where management has used estimates, assumptions, or exercised judgements\nare as follows:\n\u2022 Classification of financial assets \u2013 assessment of the business model within which the assets are held and\nassessment of whether the contractual terms of the financial asset are solely payments of principal and\ninterest (\u201cSPPI\u201d) on the principal amount outstanding (note 3c);\n\u2022 Impairment losses on financial assets (note 2di) and non-financial assets (note 2diii);\n\u2022 Fair value measurement (note 2dii);\n\u2022 Determination of control over investment funds (note 2div);\n\u2022 Determination of significant influence over investees, including assessment of potential voting rights (note\n2dv);\n\u2022 Going concern (note 2dvi);\n\u2022 Lease liabilities \u2013 determination of lease terms and estimation of the Incremental Borrowing Rate (\u201cIBR\u201d)\n(note 2dvii);\n\u2022\nPage | 17"

These estimates are driven by a number of factors, and the changes to these factors can result in\ndifferent levels of allowances.\nThe Group\u2019s Expected Credit Loss (\u201cECL\u201d) calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of\nunderlying assumptions regarding the choice of variable inputs and their interdependencies.\nElements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgements and estimates include:\n\u2022 The Group\u2019s internal credit grading model, which assigns Probability of Defaults (\u201cPDs\u201d) to individual\ngrades;\n\u2022 The Group\u2019s criteria for assessing if there has been a significant increase in credit risk (\u201cSICR\u201d) where\nallowances for financial assets should be measured on a Lifetime ECL basis and the qualitative\nassessment;\n\u2022 The segmentation of financial assets when their ECL is assessed on a collective basis;\n\u2022 Development of ECL models, including the various formulas and the choice of inputs;\n\u2022 Determination of associations between macroeconomic scenarios and economic inputs, such as Real\nGross Domestic Product (\u201cGDP\u201d), Government expenditure, Interest rates and Real import and collateral\nvalues, and the effect on PDs, Exposures at Default (\u201cEADs\u201d) and Loss Given Defaults (\u201cLGDs\u201d); and\n\u2022 Selection of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios and their probability weightages, to derive the\neconomic inputs into the ECL models.\nii) Fair value measurement\nThe Group measures financial instruments, such as derivatives, at fair value at each consolidated statement\nof financial position date, except as disclosed in note 30c.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. It assumes that transaction take place\neither:\n\u2022 In the principal market for the asset or liability, or\n\u2022 In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to or by the Group. The fair value of an\nasset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the\nasset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their best economic interest. A fair value\nmeasurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic\nbenefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would\nuse the asset in its highest and best use.\nThe Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data\nis available to measure fair value, while maximizing the use of relevant observable market inputs and\nminimizing the use of unobservable inputs.\nPage | 18"

Basis of preparation - continued\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated statement of\nfinancial position are categorized within a fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level\ninput that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\nLevel 1. Quoted prices in active markets for the same or identical instrument that an entity can access at the\nmeasurement date (i.e., without modification or proxy);\nLevel 2. Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities or other valuation techniques for\nwhich all significant inputs are based on observable market data; and\nLevel 3. Valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position on a recurring\nbasis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between Levels in the hierarchy by re-\nassessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a\nwhole) at the end of each financial reporting period.\nThe Group determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, such as\nunquoted financial assets, and for any non-recurring measurement, such as assets held for distribution in\ndiscontinued operations.\nExternal subject matter experts are involved from time to time for the valuation of certain assets.\nInvolvement of external subject matter experts is decided upon annually. Selection criteria include market\nknowledge, reputation, independence, and whether professional standards are maintained.\nAt each financial reporting date, the Group analyzes the movements in the values of assets and liabilities\nwhich are required to be re-measured or re-assessed as per the Group\u2019s accounting policies. For this analysis,\nthe Group verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the\nvaluation computation to contracts and other relevant documents. The Group also compares the changes in\nthe fair value of each asset and liability with relevant external sources to determine whether the change is\nreasonable.\nFor the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined the classes of assets and liabilities on the\nbasis of the nature, characteristics, and the related risks of the asset or liability, and the level of the fair value\nhierarchy as explained above\niii) Impairment of non-financial assets\nThe carrying amount of non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date or more frequently to\ndetermine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset\u2019s\nrecoverable amount is estimated.\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit (\u201cCGU\u201d)\nexceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of its value in use\nand its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to\ntheir present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of\nmoney and the risks specific to the asset. The fair value less costs to sell is based on observable market prices\nor, if no observable market prices exist, estimated prices for similar assets or if no estimated prices for similar\nassets are available, then based on discounted future cash flow calculations.\nImpairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the\nloss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the\nestimates used to determine the recoverable amount.\nPage | 19"

As a result, the Group has concluded that it acts as an agent for the investors in all cases,\nand therefore has not consolidated the financial statements of these funds.\nv) Determination of significant influence over investees\nSignificant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee\nbut is not control or joint control over those policies. Management uses judgement when determining\nwhether the Group has significant influence over investees. Management also considers the existence and\neffect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible, including potential voting rights\nheld by other entities.\nIn assessing whether potential voting rights contribute to significant influence, the Group examines all facts\nand circumstances (including the terms of exercise of the potential voting rights, the probable time frame to\nexercise the potential voting rights and any other contractual arrangements whether considered individually\nor in combination) that affect potential rights, except the intention of management and the financial ability\nto exercise or convert.\nThe key judgments applied in determination of significant influence over investees are set out in note 8b.\nvi) Going concern\nThe Group\u2019s management has made an assessment of the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and\nis satisfied that the Group has the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Furthermore,\nmanagement is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability\nto continue as a going concern. Therefore, the consolidated financial statements are prepared on the going\nconcern basis.\nvii) Determination of lease terms\nIn determining the lease terms for the purposes of calculation of lease liabilities and Right of Use (\u201cROU\u201d)\nleased assets, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to\nexercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after\ntermination options) are only included in the lease terms if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended or\nnot terminated.\nThe Group also reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant\nevent or significant change in circumstances within its control.\nviii) Depreciation and amortization\nManagement uses judgement when determining the periods used for purposes of calculating depreciation\nand amortization for property, equipment, ROU leased assets and Information Technology intangible assets.\nThe judgement includes estimates of any residual values, the estimated periods over which future economic\nbenefits will flow to the Group, and the choice of depreciation and amortization methods.\nPage | 20"

Management makes judgments in\nassigning the risk that might exist in such claims. It also sets appropriate provisions against probable losses.\nThe claims are recorded or disclosed, as appropriate, in the consolidated financial statements based on the\nbest estimate of the amount required to settle the claim.\nx) Employee Benefit obligation\nThe Group operates an end of service benefit plan for its employees based on the prevailing Saudi Labor\nlaws.

The Group classifies, as part of equity, the Tier I Sukuk issued with no fixed\nredemption dates (Perpetual Sukuk) and not obliging the Group for payment of special commission upon the\noccurrence of a non-payment event or non-payment election, whereby the Group may at its sole discretion\n(subject to certain terms and conditions) elect not to make any distributions. Such a non-payment event or\nnon-payment election represents that the remedies available to the Sukukholders are limited in number and\nscope and are very difficult to exercise.\nThe related initial costs and distributions thereon are recognized directly in the consolidated statement of\nchanges in equity under retained earnings as \u201cTier I Sukuk costs\u201d.\n3.

The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as\nthat of the Bank, using consistent accounting policies. Changes are made to the accounting policies of the\nsubsidiaries when necessary to align with the accounting policies of the Group.\nSubsidiaries are investees controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when it is exposed, or has\nrights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns\nthrough its power over the investee. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated\nfinancial statements from the date the Group obtains control of the investee and ceases when the Group loses\ncontrol of the investee.\nSpecifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:\n\u2022 Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of\nthe investee);\n\u2022 Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and\n\u2022 The ability to use its power over the investee to affect amount of its returns.\nPage | 23"

Summary of material accounting policies \u2013 continued\nWhen the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all\nrelevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:\n\u2022 The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;\n\u2022 Rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and\n\u2022 The Group\u2019s voting rights and potential voting rights granted by equity instruments such as shares.\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are\nchanges to one or more of the three elements of control summarized above. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins\nwhen the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control over the\nsubsidiary. Income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the\nconsolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date the Group obtains control until the date the\nGroup ceases to control the subsidiary.\nA change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity\ntransaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:\n\u2022 Derecognizes the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary;\n\u2022 Derecognizes the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests;\n\u2022 Derecognizes the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity;\n\u2022 Recognizes the fair value of the consideration received;\n\u2022 Recognizes the fair value of any investment retained;\n\u2022 Recognizes any surplus or deficit in the consolidated statement of income; and\n\u2022 Reclassifies the parent\u2019s share of components previously recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (\u201cOCI\u201d)\nto the consolidated statement of income or retained earnings, as appropriate, as would be required if the\nGroup had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\nAll Intra-group balances and any income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in\npreparing these consolidated financial statements.\nc) Financial assets and financial liabilities\ni) Recognition and Initial measurement\nA financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL,\ntransaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.\nii) Classification of financial assets\nOn initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortized cost, FVOCI or FVTPL.\nFinancial Assets at amortized cost\nA financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not\ndesignated at FVTPL:\n\u2022 The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash\nflows; and\n\u2022 The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely\npayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\nPage | 24"

Special commission income and foreign exchange gains and losses are\nrecognized in the consolidated statement of income.\nEquity Investments\nOn initial recognition, for an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect\nto present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an instrument-by-instrument\n(i.e. share-by-share) basis.\nFinancial Assets at FVTPL\nAll other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL.\nIn addition, on initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise\nmeets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or\nsignificantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\nReclassification\nFinancial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the\nGroup changes its business model for managing financial assets.\nBusiness model assessment\nThe Group makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio\nlevel because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to\nmanagement. The information considered includes:\n\u2022 The stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In\nparticular, whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual special commission revenue,\nmaintaining a particular special commission rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to\nthe duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets, or realizing cash flows through the sale of the\nassets;\n\u2022 How the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management;\n\u2022 The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that\nbusiness model) and how those risks are managed;\n\u2022 How managers of the business are compensated - e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value\nof the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and\n\u2022 The frequency, volume, and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and the\nexpectations about future sales activity.

Summary of material accounting policies - continued\nThe business model assessment is also based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking \u201cworst case\u201d\nor \u201cstress case\u201d scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realized in a way that is\ndifferent from the Group's original expectations, the Group does not change the classification of the\nremaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing\nnewly originated or newly purchased financial assets in the future.\nFinancial assets that may be held for trading and for which performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are\nmeasured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held to both collect\ncontractual cash flows and to sell the financial assets.\nAssessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest\nFor the purposes of this assessment, \u201cprincipal\u201d is the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition.\n\u201cSpecial commission\u201d is the consideration for the time value of money, the credit and other basic lending\nrisks associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period and other basic lending\ncosts (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), along with a profit margin.\nIn assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group\nconsiders the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset\ncontains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it\nwould not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Group considers:\n\u2022 Contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;\n\u2022 Leverage features;\n\u2022 Prepayment and extension terms;\n\u2022 Terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse asset\narrangements); and\n\u2022 Features that modify consideration of the time value of money - e.g. periodical reset of special\ncommission rates.\niii) Classification of financial liabilities\nThe Group classifies its financial liabilities at amortized cost. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into\naccount any discount or premium on issued funds, and costs that are an integral part of the expected special\ncommission rate.\niv) Derecognition\nFinancial assets\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial\nasset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which\nsubstantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the\nGroup neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not\nretain control of the financial asset.\nOn derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the\ncarrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognized) and the sum of (i) the consideration\nreceived (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or\nloss that had been recognized in OCI is recognized in the consolidated statement of income.\nWhen assets are sold to a third party with a concurrent total rate of return swap on the transferred assets,\nthe transaction is accounted for as a secured financing transaction similar to sale and repurchase\ntransactions, as the Group retains all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of such assets.\nPage | 26"

Summary of material accounting policies - continued\nIn transactions in which the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of\nownership of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Group continues to recognize the\nasset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes\nin the value of the transferred asset.\nIn certain transactions, the Group may retain the obligation to service a transferred financial asset for a fee.\nThe transferred asset is derecognized if it meets the derecognition criteria. However, an asset or liability is\nrecognized for the servicing contract if the servicing fee is more than adequate (asset) or is less than\nadequate (liability) for performing the servicing.\nThe Group may securitize various loans and advances to customers or investment securities, which generally\nresult in the sale of these assets to unconsolidated securitization vehicles and the Bank transferring\nsubstantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. The securitization vehicles in turn issue securities to\ninvestors. Interests in the securitized financial assets are generally retained in the form of senior or\nsubordinated tranches, interest-only strips or other residual interests (retained interests). Retained interests\nare recognized as investment securities and carried at FVOCI. Gains or losses on securitization are recorded\nin the consolidated statement of income.\nAny cumulative gain / loss recognized in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated at FVOCI is\nnot recognized in the consolidated statement of income on derecognition of such securities. Cumulative\ngains and losses recognized in OCI in respect of such equity investment securities are transferred to retained\nearnings on disposal. Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify for derecognition that is created\nor retained by the Bank is recognized as a separate asset or liability.\nFinancial liabilities\nThe Group derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled, or\nexpire.\nv) Modifications of financial assets and financial liabilities\nIf the terms of a financial asset are modified, the Group evaluates whether the cash flows of the modified\nasset are substantially different. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to\ncash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial\nasset is derecognized and a new financial asset is recognized at fair value.\nIn case the modification of asset does not result in de-recognition, the Group will recalculate the gross\ncarrying amount of the asset by discounting the modified contractual cash-flows using Effective Interest Rate\n(EIR) prior to the modification. Any difference between the recalculated amount and the existing gross\ncarrying amount is recognized in the consolidated statement of income for asset modification.\nThe Group derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified\nliability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is\nrecognized at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability extinguished\nand the new financial liability with modified terms is recognized in the consolidated statement of income.\nvi) Interest rate benchmark reform\nIf the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability measured at\namortized cost changed as a result of interest rate benchmark reform, then the Group updated the effective\ninterest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by the reform. A\nchange in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform\nif the following conditions are met:\nPage | 27"

After that, the Group applied the policies on accounting for modifications to\nthe additional changes\nvii) Impairment\nThe Group recognizes loss allowances for ECL on the following financial instruments that are not measured\nat FVTPL:\n\u2022 financial assets that are measured at amortized cost;\n\u2022 debt instruments measured at FVOCI;\n\u2022 financial guarantee contracts issued; and\n\u2022 loan commitments issued.\nNo impairment loss is recognized on equity investments.\nThe Bank measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for the following, for which\nthey are measured equal to a 12-month ECL:\n\u2022 Debt investment securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and\n\u2022 Other financial instruments on which credit risk has not increased significantly since their initial\nrecognition.\nThe Group considers a debt security to have low credit risk when their credit risk rating is equivalent to the\nglobally understood definition of 'investment grade'.\n12-month ECL is the portion of ECL that results from default events on a financial instrument that are\npossible within the 12 months after the reporting date.\nMeasurement of ECL\nECL is a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. ECL is measured as follows:\n\u2022 Financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash\nshortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract\nand the cash flows that the Group expects to receive);\n\u2022 Financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross\ncarrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows;\n\u2022 Undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows\nthat are due to the Bank if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Bank expects to\nreceive; and\n\u2022 Financial guarantee contracts: as the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that\nthe Bank expects to recover.\nWhen discounting future cash flows, the following discount rates are used:\n\u2022 Lease receivables: the discount rate used in measuring lease receivables;\n\u2022 Undrawn loan commitments: the effective interest rate, or an approximation thereof, that will be applied\nto the financial asset resulting from the loan commitment; and\nPage | 28"

This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset\nthat are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original\neffective interest rate of the existing financial asset.\nCredit impaired financial assets\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt\nsecurities carried at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events\nthat have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.\nEvidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\u2022 Significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;\n\u2022 A breach of contract such as a default or past due event;\n\u2022 The restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Bank would not consider\notherwise;\n\u2022 It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; or\n\u2022 The disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\nA loan that has been renegotiated due to deterioration in the borrower's condition is usually considered to\nbe credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced\nsignificantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a loan that is overdue for 90 days\nor more is considered impaired.\nIn making an assessment as to whether an investment in sovereign debt is credit-impaired, the Group\nconsiders the following factors:\n\u2022 The market's assessment of creditworthiness as reflected in the bond yields;\n\u2022 The rating agencies' assessments of creditworthiness;\n\u2022 The country's ability to access the capital markets for new debt issuance;\n\u2022 The probability of debt being restructured, resulting in holders suffering losses through voluntary or\nmandatory debt forgiveness; and\nPage | 29"

The combined\namount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn component. Any\nexcess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as an\nallowance in other liabilities; and\n\u2022 For debt securities measured at FVOCI, no loss allowance is recognized against financial assets\nbecause the carrying amount of these assets is considered fair value. However, the loss allowance is\ndisclosed and is included in OCI.\nviii) Collaterals\nCollateral valuation\nTo mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral\ncomes in various forms, such as cash, securities, letters of credit/guarantees, real estate, receivables,\ninventories, other non-financial assets and credit enhancements such as netting agreements. Collateral,\nunless repossessed, is not recorded on the Bank\u2019s statement of financial position. However, the fair value of\ncollateral affects the calculation of ECLs. It is generally assessed, at a minimum, at inception and re-assessed\non a periodic basis. However, some collateral, for example, cash or securities relating to margining\nrequirements, is valued daily.\nTo the extent possible, the Bank uses active market data for valuing financial assets held as collateral. Other\nfinancial assets which do not have readily determinable market values are valued using models. Non-\nfinancial collateral, such as real estate, is valued based on data provided by third parties such as mortgage\nbrokers, or based on housing price indices.\nCollateral repossessed\nThe Bank\u2019s policy is to determine whether a repossessed asset can be best used for its internal operations or\nshould be sold.\nAssets determined to be useful for the internal operations are transferred to their relevant asset category at\nthe lower of their repossessed value or the carrying value of the original secured asset. Assets for which\nselling is determined to be a better option are transferred to assets held for sale at their fair value (if\nfinancial assets) and fair value less cost to sell for non-financial assets at the repossession date in, line with\nthe Bank\u2019s policy.\nIn its normal course of business, the Bank does not physically repossess properties or other assets in its retail\nportfolio, but engages external agents to recover funds, generally at auction, to settle outstanding debt. Any\nsurplus funds are returned to the customers/obligors. As a result of this practice, the residential properties\nunder legal repossession processes are not recorded on the balance sheet.\nPage | 30"

Summary of material accounting policies \u2013 continued\nix) Write-offs\nLoans and debt securities are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of\nrecovery. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in\norder to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due. If the amount to be written off is\ngreater than the accumulated allowance for credit losses, the difference is first treated as an addition to the\nallowance and then applied against the gross carrying amount. Any subsequent recoveries are credited to\nprovisions for credit losses.\nx) Offsetting financial instruments\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and are reported net in the consolidated statement of financial\nposition when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts, when the Group intends\nto settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nIncome and expenses are not offset in the consolidated statement of income unless required or permitted\nby any accounting standard or interpretation, and as specifically disclosed in the accounting policies of the\nGroup.\nxi) Financial guarantees and loan commitments\n'Financial guarantees' are contracts that require the Bank to make specified payments to reimburse the\nholder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in accordance\nwith the terms of a debt instrument.\nThe premium received is recognized in the income statement in Net fees and commission income on a\nstraight-line basis over the life of the guarantee.\n'Loan commitments and letter of credits' are firm commitments under which, over the duration of the\ncommitments, the Bank is required to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions Similar to\nfinancial guarantee contracts, these contracts are in the scope of the ECL requirements.\nThe nominal contractual value of financial guarantees, letters of credit and loan commitments, where the\nloan agreed to be provided is on market terms, are not recorded on in the statement of financial position. The\nnominal values of these instruments together with the corresponding ECL is recorded.\nFinancial guarantees issued or commitments to provide loan at a below market interest rate are initially\nmeasured at fair value. Subsequently, they are measured at the higher of the loss allowance determined in\naccordance with IFRS 9 and the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, the cumulative amount\nof income recognized in accordance with the principle of IFRS 15. Other loan commitments issued are\nmeasured at the sum of (i) the loss allowance determined in accordance with IFRS 9 and (ii) the amount of\nany fees received, less, if the commitment is unlikely to result in a specific lending arrangement, the\ncumulative amount of income recognized.\n\u2022 The Bank issued no loan commitment that are measured at FVTPL.\n\u2022 Liabilities arising from financial guarantees and loan commitments are included within provisions\nPage | 31"

Summary of material accounting policies - continued\nd) Investments in associates\nInvestments in associates are initially recognized at cost and subsequently accounted for under the equity\nmethod of accounting. An associate is an entity in which the Bank has significant influence (but not control) over\nfinancial and operating matters and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture.\nInvestments in associates are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost, plus post-\nacquisition changes in the Group\u2019s share of the net assets of the associates, less any impairment in the value of\nindividual investments. Share in earnings of associates includes the changes in the Group\u2019s share of the net assets\nof the associates. The Group\u2019s share of its associates post-acquisition income or losses is recognized in the\nconsolidated statement of income and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is\nrecognized in OCI included in shareholders\u2019 equity. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted\nagainst the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group\u2019s share of losses in an associate equal or\nexceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognize\nfurther losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. Goodwill relating\nto the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortized nor individually\ntested for impairment.\nUnrealized gains and losses on transactions between the Bank and its associates are eliminated to the extent of\nthe Group\u2019s interest in the associates.\nThe consolidated statement of income reflects the Group\u2019s share of the results of operations of the associates.\nWhen there has been a change recognized directly in the equity of the associates, the Group recognizes its share\nof any changes and discloses this, when applicable, in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.\nUnrealized gains on transactions are eliminated to the extent of the Group\u2019s interest in the investees. Unrealized\nlosses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment in the asset transferred.\nThe Group\u2019s share of earnings in an associate is shown on the face of the consolidated statement of income,\nwhich represents the net earnings attributable to equity holders of an associate i.e. income after Zakat and\nIncome tax and non-controlling interests.\nThe financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When\nnecessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.\nAfter application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognize an\nimpairment loss on an investment in an associate. The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is\nany objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates\nthe amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying\nvalue and recognizes the impairment loss in the consolidated statement of income.\nPage | 32"

Summary of material accounting policies - continued\nWhen the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, the difference\nbetween the carrying amount of associate and the consideration received is recognized in the consolidated\nstatement of income. Proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in OCI are reclassified to\nconsolidated statement of income, where appropriate upon reduction of ownership interest in an associate.\ne) Settlement date accounting\nAll regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on the settlement date,\ni.e. the date the asset is delivered to the counterparty. When settlement date accounting is applied, the Bank\naccounts for any change in the fair value between the trade date and the settlement date in the same way as it\naccounts for the acquired asset. Regular-way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that\nrequire delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the market\nplace.\nf) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\nAs permitted by IFRS 9 \u2013 Financial Instruments, the Group has elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting\nrequirements of IAS 39 \u2013 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.\nDerivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange contracts, commission rate futures, forward rate\nagreements, currency and commission rate swaps, and currency and commission rate options (both written and\npurchased) are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which the derivatives contract is entered into and\nare subsequently re-measured at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position with the\ntransaction costs recognized in the consolidated statement of income. All derivatives are carried at their fair\nvalue as assets where the net fair value is positive and as liabilities where the net fair value is negative. Fair\nvalues are obtained by reference to quoted market prices, discounted cash flow methods, and pricing models, as\nappropriate.\nThe treatment of changes in their fair value depends on their classification into the following categories:\ni) Derivatives held for trading\nAny changes in the fair value of derivatives that are held for trading purposes are taken directly to the\nconsolidated statement of income and disclosed in trading income. Derivatives held for trading also include\nthose derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.\nii) Embedded derivatives\nDerivatives may be embedded in another contractual arrangement (a host contract). The Group accounts for\nan embedded derivative separately from the host contract when:\n\u2022 The host contract is not an asset in the scope of IFRS 9;\n\u2022 The terms of the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative if they were contained\nin a separate contract; and\n\u2022 The economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the\neconomic characteristics and risks of the host contract.\nSeparate embedded derivatives are measured at fair value, with all changes in fair value recognized in the\nconsolidated statement of income unless they form part of qualifying cash flow or net investment hedging\nrelationship in which case all changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statement of\ncomprehensive income.\nPage | 33"

Summary of material accounting policies \u2013 continued\niii) Hedge accounting\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in qualifying hedging relationships to\nmanage exposures to interest rates, foreign currency, and credit risks, including exposures arising from\nhighly probable forecasted transactions and firm commitments. In order to manage a particular risk, the\nBank applies hedge accounting for transactions that meet specific criteria.\nFor the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified into two categories:\n(a) fair value hedges which hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability,\n(or assets or liabilities in the case of portfolio hedging), or an unrecognized firm commitment or an\nidentified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk\nand could affect the reported net gain or loss; and\n(b) cash flow hedges which hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a\nparticular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or to a highly probable forecasted transaction\nthat will affect the reported net gain or loss.\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge should be expected to be highly effective, i.e. the\nchanges in fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument should effectively offset corresponding changes\nin the hedged risk, and should be reliably measurable. At inception of the hedge, the risk management\nobjective and strategy are documented including the identification of the hedging instrument, the related\nhedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how the Group will assess the effectiveness of the\nhedging relationship. Subsequently, the hedge is required to be assessed and determined to be an effective\nhedge.\nAt each hedge effectiveness assessment / reporting date, each hedge relationship must be expected to be\nhighly effective on a prospective basis and demonstrate that it was effective (retrospective effectiveness) for\nthe designated period in order to qualify for hedge accounting. A formal assessment is undertaken by\ncomparing the hedging instrument\u2019s effectiveness in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows\nattributable to the hedged risk in the hedged item, at inception and at each quarter end on an ongoing basis.\nA hedge is expected to be highly effective if the changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged\nrisk during the period for which the hedge is designated were offset by the hedging instrument in a range of\n80% to 125% and were expected to achieve such offset in future periods. Hedge ineffectiveness if significant\nis recognized in the consolidated statement of income. For situations where the hedged item is a forecasted\ntransaction, the Group also assesses whether the transaction is highly probable and presents an exposure to\nvariations in cash flows that could ultimately affect the consolidated statement of income.\nFair value hedges\nWhen a derivative is designated as a hedging instrument in the hedge of a change in fair value of a\nrecognized asset or liability or a firm commitment that could affect the consolidated statement of income,\nany gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instruments to fair value is recognized immediately in the\nconsolidated statement of income together with the change in the fair value of the attributable hedged risk\nin special commission income.\nFor hedged items measured at amortized cost, where the fair value hedge of a commission bearing financial\ninstrument ceases to meet the criteria for hedge accounting or is sold, exercised or terminated, the\ndifference between the carrying value of the hedged item on termination and the face value is amortized\nover the remaining term of the original hedge using the effective interest rate method. If the hedged item is\nderecognized, the unamortized fair value adjustment is recognized immediately in the consolidated\nstatement of income.\nPage | 34"

Summary of material accounting policies \u2013 continued\ng) Fore ign currencies\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into SAR at the exchange rates prevailing at transaction dates.\nMonetary assets and liabilities at year-end, denominated in foreign currencies, are translated into SAR at the\nexchange rates prevailing at the consolidated statement of financial position date.\nThe foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortized cost in the functional\ncurrency at the beginning of the year adjusted for effective interest rates and payments during the year, and the\namortized cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the year. All differences arising\non non-trading activities are taken to other non-operating income in the consolidated statement of income, with\nthe exception of differences of foreign currency borrowings that provide an effective hedge against a net\ninvestment in a foreign entity. Foreign exchange gains or losses on translation of monetary assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the consolidated statement of income except for differences\narising on the retranslation of equity instruments or when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying\ncash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges to the extent hedges are effective. Translation gains or\nlosses on non-monetary items carried at fair value are included as part of the fair value adjustment on\ninvestment securities available for sale, unless the non-monetary items have an effective hedging strategy.\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the\nexchange rates as of the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign\ncurrency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined.\nh) Government grants\nGrants received from the government are recognized at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that\nthe grant will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. The benefit of\na SAMA deposit at a below-market commission rate is treated as a government grant related to income. Below-\nmarket rate deposits are recognized and measured in accordance with IFRS 9 \u2013 Financial Instruments and\nincluded in due to banks and other financial institutions.\nThe benefit of the below-market rate of commission is measured as the difference between the initial fair value\nof the deposit determined in accordance with IFRS 9 and the proceeds received and is presented as a discount to\ndeposits from SAMA.\nThe benefit is accounted for in accordance with the requirements of IAS 20 - Accounting for Government Grants\nand Disclosure of Government Assistance. The grant income is only recognized when the ultimate beneficiary is\nthe Group. Where the customer is the ultimate beneficiary, the Group only records the respective receivable and\npayable amounts. Government grant income is recognized in special commission income on a systematic basis to\nthe extent of related costs for which the grant is intended to compensate, with the remaining discount deferred\nand included in other liabilities.\ni) Share capital\nOrdinary shares are classified as Shareholders\u2019 equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new\nshares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.\nWhere the Group purchases own equity instruments, for example as the result of a share buy-back or a share-\nbased payment plan, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of taxes),\nis deducted from equity attributable to the Shareholders of the Bank as treasury shares until the shares are\ncancelled or reissued. Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of\nany directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity\nattributable to the Shareholders of the Bank.\nShares held by the Bank are disclosed as treasury shares and deducted from Shareholders\u2019 equity.\nPage | 35"

Summary of material accounting policies \u2013 continued\nj) Revenue / expense recognition\nRevenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group, and the\nrevenue can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is\nrecognized.\ni) Special commission income and expense\nSpecial commission income and expense for all special commission earning / bearing financial instruments\nare recognized in the consolidated statement of income on the effective special commission rate basis. The\neffective special commission rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash payments and receipts\nthrough the expected life of the financial asset or liability (or, where appropriate, a shorter period) to the\ncarrying amount of the financial asset or liability. When calculating the effective special commission rate,\nthe Group estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but not\nfuture credit losses.\nThe carrying amount of a financial asset or financial liability is adjusted if the Group revises its estimates of\npayments or receipts. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original effective special\ncommission rate and the change in carrying amount is recorded as special commission income or expense.\nIf the recorded value of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been reduced due to an\nimpairment loss, special commission income continues to be recognized on the effective special commission\nrate basis, based on the asset\u2019s carrying value net of impairment provisions.\nThe calculation of the effective special commission rate considers all contractual terms of the financial\ninstruments (prepayment, options etc.) and includes all fees paid or transaction costs, and discounts or\npremiums that are an integral part of the effective special commission rate. Transaction costs are\nincremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial asset or\nliability.\nMeasurement of amortized cost and special commission income\nThe amortized cost of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or\nfinancial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the\ncumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount\nand the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance.\nThe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is the amortized cost of a financial asset before adjusting for\nany expected credit loss allowance.\nIn calculating special commission income and expense, the effective special commission rate is applied to the\ngross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortized cost of the\nliability.\nFor financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, special commission\nincome is calculated by applying the effective special commission rate to the amortized cost of the financial\nasset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired then the calculation of special commission income reverts to\nthe gross basis.\nFor financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, special commission income is calculated\nby applying the credit-adjusted effective special commission rate to the amortized cost of the asset. The\ncalculation of special commission income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset\nimproves.\nPage | 36"

These services are either rendered separately or\nbundled together with the rendering of other services.\nRevenue from rendering of services related to share trading and fund management, trade finance, corporate\nfinance and advisory and other banking services, are recognized at the point when services are rendered i.e.\nwhen performance obligation is satisfied.\nii) Exchange income / loss\nExchange income / loss is recognized when earned / incurred and in accordance with the principles included\nin note 3g.\niii) Fee income from banking services\nFees that are considered an integral to the effective special commission rate are deferred and included in the\nmeasurement of the relevant assets.\nFees from banking services that are not an integral component of the effective special commission rate\ncalculation on a financial asset or liability are generally recognized on an accrual basis when the related\nservice is provided.\nPortfolio and other management advisory and service fees are recognized based on the applicable service\ncontracts, usually on a time-proportionate basis.\nFees received on asset management, custody services and other similar services that are provided over an\nextended period of time, are recognized over the period when the service is being provided.\nPerformance linked fees or fee components are recognized when the performance criteria is fulfilled.\nLoan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down and other credit related fees are deferred,\ntogether with the investment costs, and recognized as an adjustment to the effective special commission\nrate on the loan. When a loan commitment is not expected to result in the draw-down of a loan, loan\ncommitment fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the commitment period.\nOther fees and commission expense relate mainly to transaction and service fees, and are recognized as\nexpenses as the services are received or the transaction is completed.\niv) Dividend income\nDividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established.\nv) Day 1 profit or loss\nWhere a transaction price differs from the fair value of other observable current market transactions in the\nsame instrument or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable\nmarkets, the Group immediately recognizes the difference between the transaction price and fair value (a\nDay 1 profit or loss) in the consolidated statement of income. In cases where use is made of data which is not\nobservable, the difference between the transaction price and model value is only recognized in the\nconsolidated statement of income when the inputs become observable, or when the instrument is\nderecognized.\nPage | 37"

Summary of material accounting policies \u2013 continued\nvi) Customer loyalty programs\nThe Group offers customer loyalty programs referred to as reward points, which allows customers to earn\npoints that can be redeemed through certain partner outlets. The Group allocates a portion of the\ntransaction price to the reward points awarded to members, based on estimates of costs of future\nredemptions. The amount of expense allocated to reward points is charged to the consolidated statement\nof income with a corresponding liability recognized in other liabilities. The cumulative amount of the\nliability related to unredeemed reward points is adjusted over time based on actual redemption experience\nand current and expected trends with respect to future redemptions.\nj) Repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements\nAssets sold with a simultaneous commitment to repurchase at a specified future date (repurchase agreements)\ncontinue to be recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position as the Group retains substantially\nall of the risks and rewards of ownership and are measured in accordance with related accounting policies for\ninvestments. The transactions are treated as a collateralized borrowing and the counter party liability for\namounts received under these agreements is included in due to banks and other financial institutions, as\nappropriate. The difference between the sale and repurchase price is treated as special commission expense and\nrecognized over the life of the repurchase agreement on an effective yield basis.\nUnderlying assets purchased with a corresponding commitment to resell at a specified future date (reverse\nrepurchase agreements) are not recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position, as the Group\ndoes not obtain control over the underlying assets. Amounts paid under these agreements are included in due\nfrom banks and other financial institutions, net. The difference between the purchase and resale price is treated\nas special commission income and recognized over the life of the reverse repurchase agreement on an effective\nyield basis.\nk) Impairment of non-financial assets\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that non-financial assets may be\nimpaired. If any indication exists, or when periodic impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group\nestimates the asset\u2019s recoverable amount. An asset\u2019s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset\u2019s or cash-\ngenerating unit\u2019s (\u201cCGU\u201d) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset\nor CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable\namount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a\ndiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the\nasset. In determining an asset\u2019s fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used. These model\ncalculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, or other available fair value indicators.\nl) Other real estate\nThe Group, in the ordinary course of business, acquires certain real estate against settlement of loans and\nadvances. Such real estate is considered as held for sale and is initially stated at the lower of net realizable value\nof the loans and advances and the current fair value of the related properties, less any costs to sell, if material.\nNo depreciation is charged on such real estate.\nSubsequent to initial recognition, any subsequent write down to fair value, less costs to sell, are charged to the\nconsolidated statement of income. Any subsequent gain in the fair value less costs to sell these assets to the\nextent this does not exceed the cumulative write down is recognized together with any gain/ loss on disposal in\nthe consolidated statement of income.\nPage | 38"

Land is not depreciated. Goodwill is not amortized. The costs of other property, equipment,\nand intangible assets are depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives\nof the assets as follows:\nBuildings 20 to 30 years\nLeasehold improvements Over the lease period or 5 years, whichever is shorter\nFurniture, equipment and vehicles 4 to 5 years\nInformation technology intangible assets 8 years\nThe assets\u2019 residual values, useful lives, and depreciation or amortization methods are reviewed and adjusted, if\nappropriate, at each reporting date. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with\ncarrying amounts. These are included in the consolidated statement of income.\nOther expenditures are capitalized only when it is probable that the future economic benefit of the expenditure\nwill flow to the Group. Ongoing repairs and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred.\nAssets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount may not be recoverable. Any carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if\nthe asset\u2019s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.\nn) Leases\nAt the inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or\ncontains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in\nexchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified\nasset, the Group assesses whether:\n\u2022 the contract involves the use of an identified asset \u2013 this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should\nbe physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier\nhas a substantive substitution right, then the asset is not identified;\n\u2022 the Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout\nthe period of use; and\n\u2022 the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Group has this right when it has the decision-\nmaking rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used.\nRight-of-Use (ROU) leased assets\nThe Group recognizes an ROU leased asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The ROU leased\nasset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease\npayments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of\ncosts to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is\nlocated, less any lease incentives received.\nThe ROU leased asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date\nto the earlier of the end of the useful life of ROU leased asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful\nlives of ROU leased assets are determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition,\nthe ROU leased asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain\nremeasurements of the lease liability.\nPage | 39"

Summary of material accounting policies \u2013 continued\nLease liabilities\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the\ncommencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily\ndetermined, the Group\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate\nas the discount rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\u2022 fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;\n\u2022 variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the\ncommencement date;\n\u2022 amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and\n\u2022 the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments\nin an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and\npenalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.\nA lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective special commission rate method increasing the\ncarrying amount to reflect special commission on the lease liability and reducing the carrying amount to reflect\nthe lease payments made including prepayments.\nThe lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an\nindex or rate, if there is a change in the Group\u2019s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual\nvalue guarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or\ntermination option. When the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying\namount of the ROU asset, or is recorded in consolidated statement of income if the carrying amount of ROU\nasset has been reduced to zero.\nThe Group presents ROU leased assets in \u2018Property and equipment\u2019 and lease liabilities in \u2018Other liabilities\u2019 in the\nconsolidated statement of financial position.\nLeases of low-value assets\nThe Group has elected not to recognize ROU leased assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets. The\nGroup recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the\nlease term.\no) Provisions\nProvisions are recognized for on and off balance sheet items when a reliable estimate can be made by the Group\nfor a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and it is more likely than not that an\noutflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.\np) Cash and cash equivalents\nFor the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are defined as those\namounts included in cash and balances with SAMA excluding statutory deposits, net, and due from banks and\nother financial institutions maturing within three months from the date of acquisition which are also subject to\ninsignificant risk of changes in their fair value.\nq) Zakat and Value Added tax\nThe Group is subject to Zakat in accordance with the regulations of the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority\n(\u201cZATCA\u201d). Provisions for Zakat are charged to the consolidated statement of income.\nPage | 40"

It establishes provisions, where appropriate, on the basis of\namounts expected to be paid to the ZATCA. Adjustments arising from final assessments are recorded in the\nperiod in which such assessments are made.\nSince Zakat is not accounted for similar to Income tax, no deferred Zakat is calculated.\nValue Added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d)\nThe Group collects VAT from its customers for qualifying services provided, and makes VAT payments to its\nvendors for qualifying payments. On a monthly basis, net VAT remittances are made to the ZATCA representing\nVAT collected from its customers, net of any recoverable VAT on payments. Unrecoverable VAT is borne by the\nGroup and is either expensed or in the case of property, equipment, and intangibles payments, is capitalized and\neither depreciated or amortized as part of the capital cost.\nr) Short-term employees\u2019 benefits and Employee end of service benefit plan\nShort-term employees\u2019 benefits are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service\nis provided.

The Group\u2019s share of these funds is included in\ninvestments and fees earned are included in fee income from banking services, net. The Group\u2019s share of\ninvestment in these funds is included in the FVTPL investments.\nAssets held in trust or in a fiduciary capacity are not treated as assets of the Group and accordingly are not\nincluded in the consolidated financial statements.\nt) Islamic banking products\nIn addition to conventional banking, the Group offers to its customers certain non-interest based banking\nproducts, which are approved by its Shariah Board. High level definitions of non-interest based products\ninclude:\ni. Murabaha - an agreement whereby the Group sells to a customer a commodity or an asset, which the Group\nhas purchased and acquired based on a promise received from the customer to buy. The selling price\ncomprises the cost plus an agreed profit margin.\nii. Tawaruq \u2013 a form of Murabaha transaction where the Group purchases a commodity and sells it to the\ncustomer. The customer sells the underlying commodity at spot and uses the proceeds for his financing\nrequirements.\niii.

Derivatives\na) In the ordinary course of business, the Bank utilizes the following derivative financial instruments for trading and\nhedging purposes:\ni. Swaps\nSwaps are commitments to exchange one set of cash flows for another. For special commission rate swaps,\ncounterparties generally exchange fixed and floating rate commission payments in a single currency without\nexchanging notional amounts. For cross-currency special commission rate swaps, notional amounts, and fixed and\nfloating special commission payments are exchanged in different currencies. The notional amounts can also vary\nbased upon the agreed terms in the case of variable notional swaps.\nii. Forwards and futures\nForwards and futures are contractual agreements to either buy or sell a specified currency, commodity or financial\ninstrument at a specified price and date in the future. Forwards are customized contracts transacted in the over-the-\ncounter market. Foreign currency and special commission rate futures are transacted in standardized amounts on\nregulated exchanges and changes in futures contract values are settled daily.\niii. Forward rate agreements\nForward rate agreements are individually negotiated special commission rate contracts that call for a cash settlement\nfor the difference between a contracted special commission rate and the market rate on a specified future date, on a\nnotional principal, for an agreed period of time.\nPage | 54"

    "text": "The Saudi Investment Bank\nNotes to consolidated financial statements - continued\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023\n11. Derivatives \u2013 continued\niv. Options\nOptions are contractual agreements under which the seller (writer) grants the purchaser (holder) the right, but not the\nobligation, to either buy or sell at a fixed future date or at any time during a specified period, a specified amount of a\ncurrency, commodity, or financial instrument at a pre-determined price.\nb) The derivative financial instruments are either held for trading or held for hedging purposes as described below:\ni. Held for trading purposes\nMost of the Bank\u2019s derivative trading activities relate to sales, positioning and arbitrage. Sales activities involve offering\nproducts to customers and banks in order, inter alia, to enable them to transfer, modify or reduce current and future\nrisks. Positioning involves managing market risk positions with the expectation of profit from favorable movements in\nprices, rates or indices. Arbitrage involves identifying, with the expectation of profit from price differentials, between\nmarkets or products.\nii. Held for hedging purposes\nThe Bank has adopted a comprehensive system for the measurement and management of risk. The risk management\nprocess involves managing the Bank\u2019s exposure to fluctuations in currency and special commission rate risks to\nacceptable levels as determined by the Board of Directors and within the guidelines issued by SAMA.\nThe Board of Directors has established levels of currency risk by setting limits on counterparty and currency position\nexposures. Positions are routinely monitored and hedging strategies are used to ensure positions are maintained\nwithin the established limits. The Board of Directors has established the level of special commission rate risk by\nsetting limits on special commission rate gaps for stipulated periods. Asset and liability special commission rate gaps\nare reviewed on a periodic basis and hedging strategies are periodically used to manage special commission rate gap\nwithin the established limits.\nAs part of its asset and liability management, the Bank uses derivatives for hedging purposes in order to optimize its\nown exposure to currency and special commission rate risks. This is generally achieved by hedging specific\ntransactions. The Bank uses forward foreign exchange contracts to also apply various hedging strategies against\nspecifically identified currency risks. In addition, the Bank uses special commission rate swaps to hedge against the\nspecial commission rate risk arising from specifically identified fixed special commission-rate exposures.\nc) The tables below summarize the positive and negative fair values of derivative financial instruments, together with\nthe notional amounts, analyzed by the term to maturity. The notional amounts, which provide an indication of the\nvolumes of the transactions outstanding at each year-end, do not necessarily reflect the amounts of future cash\nflows involved. The notional amounts are not indicative of the Bank\u2019s exposure to credit risk which is generally\nlimited to the net positive fair values of derivatives, nor market risk.\nPage | 55"

EMIR is a body of European legislation\nfor the central clearing and regulation of Over the Counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives. The regulation includes requirements\nfor reporting of derivatives contracts and implementation of risk management standards, and establishes common\nrules for central counterparties and trade repositories. Accordingly, all such standardized OTC derivatives contracts\nare traded on exchanges and cleared through a Central Counter Party (\u201cCCP\u201d) through netting arrangements and\nexchanges of cash to reduce counter party credit and liquidity risk.\nThe positive and negative fair values of derivatives including CSA and EMIR cash margins have been netted/offset\nwhen there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and the Group intends to settle on a net\nbasis, or to realize the assets and settle the liability simultaneously. See note 29m.\ne) The Bank has a put option arising from an existing master agreement entered into by the Bank relating to an\nassociated company, the estimated value of which is included in note 11c. The terms of the agreement give the Bank\na put option and give the counter party a call option that is exercisable for the remaining term of the agreement. The\nBank has valued only the put option, as the call option is deemed to be out of the money. The put option, once\nexercised, grants the Bank the right to receive a payment in exchange for its shares one year after the exercise, based\non pre-determined formulas included in the agreement.\nf) The table below is a summary of the Bank\u2019s fair value hedges and hedged portfolios as of December 31, 2024 and\n2023, which includes the description of the hedged items and related fair values, the nature of the risk being hedged,\nand the hedging instruments and related fair values.\n2024 SAR\u2019000\nHedged items Hedging instruments\nCurrent Inception fair Instrument Positive fair Negative\nfair value value Hedged risk used value fair value\nFixed commission rate Fair value Commission\ninvestments 7,064,546 6,881,561 risk rate swaps 278,145 -\n2023 SAR\u2019000\nHedged items Hedging instruments\nCurrent Inception fair Hedged Instrument Positive fair Negative fair\nfair value value risk used value value\nFixed commission rate Fair value Commission\ninvestments 8,140,719 8,365,437 risk rate swaps 328,546 -\nThe net loss during the year on hedging instruments for fair value hedges were SAR 50.4 million (2023: gains of SAR\n134.6 million).

Cash requirements under guarantees and standby letters of credit are considerably less\nthan the amount of the commitment because the Group does not generally expect the third party to draw funds\nunder the agreement.\nDocumentary letters of credit which are written undertakings by the Group on behalf of a customer authorizing\na third party to draw drafts on the Group up to a stipulated amount under specific terms and conditions, are\ngenerally collateralized by the underlying shipments of goods to which they relate and therefore have\nsignificantly less risk.\nAcceptances comprise undertakings by the Group to pay bills of exchange drawn on customers. The Group\nexpects most acceptances to be presented before being reimbursed by the customers.\nCommitments to extend credit represent the unused portion of authorizations to extend credit, principally in\nthe form of loans and advances, guarantees and letters of credit. With respect to credit risk on commitments to\nextend credit, the Group is potentially exposed to a loss in an amount equal to the total unused commitments.\nHowever, the likely amount of loss is expected to be considerably less than the total unused commitment as\nmost commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards.\nThe total outstanding commitments to extend credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, as\nmany of these commitments could expire or terminate without being funded.\nPage | 62"

Compensation and related governance and practices \u2013 continued\nb) The Board of Directors of the Bank has established a Nomination and Remuneration Committee (the Committee)\nwhich consists of four board members. The Committee is primarily responsible for recommending\nappointments to membership of the Board of Directors and key executives of the Bank in compliance with the\nBank\u2019s Corporate Governance Guidelines, completing annual reviews for the requirements of suitable skills and\nindependence for membership of the Bank\u2019s Board of Directors, reviewing the structure of the Board of\nDirectors, establishing policies for the compensation of members of the Board of Director\u2019s, and overseeing the\nBank\u2019s employee compensation system\u2019s design.\nThe Committee is also responsible to recommend to the Board of Directors the approval of the Bank\u2019s\nCompensation Policy and any amendments thereto, to ensure that the Bank\u2019s remuneration policies are in\ncompliance with SAMA Rules on Compensation Practices and the Financial Stability Board\u2019s (FSB) Principles for\nSound Compensation Practices, to periodically review the Bank\u2019s compensation policy, to evaluate practices by\nwhich compensation is paid, and to determine the performance bonuses for the Bank\u2019s employees based on\nthe risk adjusted profit of the Bank.\nThe Bank\u2019s Compensation Policy is designed to attract, retain and motivate high performing and high potential\nemployees. Employees participate in various variable pay arrangements. Discretionary variable pay as well as\nfixed pay reviews are dependent on the achievement of objectives, which is monitored/measured via a robust\nperformance management system. The grant of the variable component of the reward is strictly dependent on\nthe achievement of set targets, both financial and non-financial, level of achievements and the Bank\u2019s overall\nperformance, including key risk indicators. Higher achievements will warrant a better performance rating and\nhigher variable compensation. The Balanced Scorecard concept is used as a performance management tool and\nPerformance objectives are typically categorized into four segments including financial, customer, process, and\npeople.\nFinancial and non-financial metrics are used to measure performance against the objectives, which include\nprofitability, expense control, customer satisfaction, quality assurance, employee development and\nengagement, workforce diversity, sustainable business practices, lending guidelines, internal controls,\ncompliance with regulations, and business systems and processes. Effective risk management is emphasized to\nmaintain a strong and secure operating platform. A Risk Appetite Framework Policy has been established and\ncompliance with the annual Risk Appetite Statement is key to all remuneration decisions including variable pay\narrangements.\nIn addition to the above, the Bank\u2019s employees are encouraged to participate in employee share savings and\nincentive schemes. Variable remuneration is linked to long-term value creation and risk horizons. It is also\nbased on individual, business segment and Bank performance criteria. Accordingly, for certain variable\nremunerations, a portion of the incentive earned for the annual performance bonus program is deferred in line\nwith long term risk realization. The vesting is subject to claw back mechanisms over a three-year period.\nThe Bank\u2019s subsidiaries have adopted a similar approach to remuneration and compensation practices as\ndescribed above, including policies within a framework of prudent risk management.\nThe total amount of compensation paid to key management for the year ended December 31, 2024 was SAR\n73.9 million (2023: SAR 56.1 million). The post-employment benefits accrued to key management for the year\nended December 31, 2024 was SAR 10.1 million (2023: SAR 2.9 million).\nThe total end of service payments made for all employees who left their employment with the Group during\nthe year ended December 31, 2024 totaled SAR 19.3 million (2023: SAR 13.9 million). These payments were\nmade to 124 beneficiaries (2023: 129). The highest payment to a single individual in 2024 was SAR 1.4 million\n(2023: SAR 1.2 million).\nPage | 66"

The Group\u2019s primary business is conducted in KSA.\nThere has been no change to the measurement basis or classification for the segment profit or loss during the\nyear ended December 31, 2024.\nPage | 67"

Market risk\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in\nmarket variables such as commission rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices. The Group classifies exposures\nto market risk into either a trading or banking book.\na) Market risk-trading book\nThe Board of Directors has set limits for the acceptable level of risks in managing the trading book. The Group\ncurrently has trading book exposures in foreign exchange contracts and commission rate swaps. Market risk\nmanagement uses the mandated standardized approach, e.g. sensitivity based method, to access the market risk\nexposure in the trading book for foreign exchange and interest rate exposure of the Bank. Additionally, the Value at\nRisk (VaR) tool is leveraged for accessing any additional exposure over the standardized approach.\nb) Market risk-banking book\nMarket risk in the banking book mainly arises from commission rate risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, and equity\nprice risk.\ni. Commission rate risk\nCommission rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in commission rates will affect either the fair\nvalues or the future cash flows of the financial instruments and obligations. The Board of Directors has\nestablished commission rate gap limits for stipulated periods. The Group monitors positions and uses hedging\nstrategies to ensure maintenance of positions within the established gap limits.\nThe following table depicts the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in commission rates, with other\nvariables held constant, on the Group\u2019s consolidated statement of income or shareholders\u2019 equity. A positive\neffect shows a potential net increase in the consolidated net income or shareholders\u2019 equity, whereas a\nnegative effect shows a potential net reduction in consolidated net income or shareholders\u2019 equity.\nThe sensitivity of net special commission income is the effect of the assumed changes in commission rates on\nthe net special commission income for one year, based on the floating rate financial assets and financial\nliabilities held as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, including the effect of hedging instruments.\nThe sensitivity of equity is calculated by revaluing the fixed rate FVOCI debt securities, excluding the effect of\nany associated fair value hedges as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 for the effect of assumed changes in\ncommission rates. The sensitivity of shareholders\u2019 equity is analyzed by maturity of the asset or swap. The\nentire banking book exposures are monitored and analyzed by currency and relevant sensitivities and are\ndisclosed in SAR thousands. For presentation purposes in the tables below, short-term fixed rate deposit\nliabilities are treated as variable rate deposits.\nPage | 72"

Liquidity risk 4\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations a3ssociated with its financial\nliabilities that are settled by delivering cash or other financial assets. Liquidity risk c6an be caused by market\ndisruptions or credit downgrades, which may cause certain sources of funding to dry up4 i mmediately. To mitigate\nthis risk, management has diversified funding sources, and assets are managed with liquidity in perspective.\nManagement therefore maintains a healthy balance of cash, cash equivalents, and readily marketable securities as\nof part of its high liquid assets. Management also monitors the asset and liability maturity profile to ensure that\nadequate liquidity is maintained. The daily liquidity position is monitored and regular liquidity stress testing is\nconducted under a variety of scenarios covering both normal and more severe market conditions. All liquidity\npolicies and procedures are subject to review and approval by the Asset Liability Committee. A summary report,\nincluding any exceptions and remedial actions taken, is submitted regularly to the Asset Liability Committee.\nIn accordance with the Banking Control Law and the regulations issued by SAMA, the Group maintains a statutory\ndeposit with SAMA equal to 7% (2023: 7%) of average demand deposits and 4% (2023: 4%) of average saving and\ntime deposits. In addition to the statutory deposit, the Group also maintains liquid reserves of no less than 20% of\nits deposit liabilities, in the form of cash and balances with SAMA, Saudi Government Development Bonds, or other\nassets which can be converted into cash within a period not exceeding 30 days. The Group has the ability to raise\nadditional funds through repo facilities with SAMA against Saudi Government Development Bonds up to 98% of the\nnominal value of Saudi Riyal denominated bonds held.\nThe Bank has an established Liquidity Risk Appetite that is approved by Board of Directors and that is reviewed\nmonthly through ALCO and with quarterly reports to the Board Risk Committee (BRC). The Risk Appetite statement\nis based on a range of key monitoring metrics, including the short-term Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the long-term\nNet Stable Funding Ratio along with Liquidity Gap limits giving due consideration to stress factors relating to both\nthe market in general and Bank specific conditions. The Bank has also established a comprehensive Contingency\nFunding Plan (CFP) using early warning monitoring metrics to forewarn Senior Management of impending stress and\nwhich establishes a clear allocation of roles and clear lines of management responsibility to address any liquidity\nstress situations.\na) Contractual maturity profile of assets and liabilities\nThe tables below summarize the contractual maturity profile of the Group\u2019s assets, liabilities, and equity as of\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023. The contractual maturities of assets and liabilities have been determined on the basis\nof the remaining period at the consolidated statement of financial position date to the contractual maturity date,\nand do not take into account the effective maturities as indicated by the Group\u2019s deposit retention history. The\namounts disclosed for derivatives, and commitments and contingencies are not indicative of future payment\nobligations.\nPage | 77"

Credit and financial risk management \u2013 continued\na) Credit Risk\nThe Group manages its exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail\nto discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. Credit exposures arise principally in\ncustomer lending activities that lead to loans and advances, and other investment activities. There is also credit\nrisk in off Balance sheet financial instruments, such as loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The\nGroup assesses the Probability of Default (PD) of counterparties using internal rating tools which can be mapped\nto external ratings where available. The Group\u2019s credit risk for derivatives represents the potential cost to\nreplace the derivative contracts if counterparties fail to fulfill their obligation, and to control the level of credit\nrisk taken. The Group assesses wholesale counterparties using the same techniques as for its lending activities to\nclients.\nConcentrations of credit risk arise when several counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or\nactivities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet\ncontractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political, or other conditions.\nConcentrations of credit risk indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group\u2019s performance to developments\naffecting a particular industry or geographical location.\nThe Group has a comprehensive Board approved framework for managing credit risk which includes an\nindependent credit risk review function and credit risk monitoring process. The Group seeks to control credit risk\nby monitoring credit exposures, limiting concentration risks, limiting transactions with specific counterparties,\nand continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. The Group\u2019s risk management policies are\ndesigned to identify and to set appropriate risk limits and to monitor the risks and adherence to limits. Actual\nexposures against limits are regularly monitored. In certain cases, the Group may also close out transactions or\nassign them to other counterparties to mitigate credit risk.\nb) Credit Risk management\nThe Group seeks to manage its credit risk exposure through diversification of lending activities to ensure that\nthere is no undue concentration of risks with individuals or groups of customers in specific locations, businesses,\nor economic sectors.\nThe Group uses a credit classification system as a tool to assist in managing the quality of credit risk within the\nlending portfolio. It maintains classification grades that differentiate between portfolios and allocates expected\ncredit loss allowances. The Group determines each individual borrower\u2019s grade based on specific objective and\nsubjective financial and business assessment criteria covering debt service, profitability, liquidity, capital structure,\nindustry, management quality, and company standing. The Group conducts periodic quality classification exercises\nover all of its existing borrowers and the results of these exercises are validated by the independent risk\nmanagement unit established for that purpose. The Group regularly reviews its risk management policies and\nsystems to reflect changes in markets, products, external economic environment, emerging best practices, and\nregulatory guidance.\nc) Credit Risk Mitigation (\u201cCRM\u201d)\nThe Group in the ordinary course of lending activities holds collateral as security for Credit Risk Mitigation (CRM)\non its loans and advances. The collateral includes primarily time, demand, and other cash deposits, financial\nguarantees, local and international equities, real estate, and other assets. The collateral is held mainly against\ncommercial and similar loans and is managed against relevant exposures at their net realizable value.\nManagement monitors the market value of collateral, requests additional collateral in accordance with underlying\nagreements, and assesses the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The Group also seeks additional\ncollateral from counterparties when impairment indicators are observed.\nPage | 82"

Credit and financial risk management \u2013 continued\nf) Credit risk grades\nThe Group allocates exposures to a credit risk grade based on an array of data that is determined to be\npredictive of the risk of default and applying experienced credit judgment. Credit risk grades are defined using\nqualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of a risk of default. These factors vary depending on the\nnature of the exposure and the type of borrower.\nCredit risk grades are defined and calibrated such that the risk of default occurring increases exponentially as the\ncredit risk deteriorates so, for example, the difference in risk of default between credit risk grades 1 and 2 is\nsmaller than the difference between credit risk grades 2 and 3.\nEach non-consumer exposure is allocated a credit risk grade at initial recognition based on available information\nabout the borrower. Exposures are subject to ongoing monitoring, which may result in an exposure being moved\nto a different credit risk grade. The monitoring of exposures involves the use of the following data:\nNon-Consumer exposures Consumer exposures All exposures\n\u2022 Information obtained during periodic \u2022 Internally collected data and \u2022 Payment record \u2013 this includes\nreviews of customer files \u2013 e.g. customer behavior \u2013 e.g. overdue status as well as a range\naudited financial statements, utilization of credit card of variables about payment ratios\nmanagement accounts, budgets, and facilities\n\u2022 Utilization of the granted limit\nprojections. Examples of areas of\n\u2022 External data from credit\nparticular focus include gross profit\n\u2022 Requests for and granting of\nreference agencies including\nmargins, financial leverage ratios,\nforbearance\nindustry-standard credit\ndebt service coverages, compliance\nscores\nwith covenants, quality\n\u2022 Existing and forecast changes in\nmanagement, and senior\n\u2022 Affordability metrics\nbusiness, financial and economic\nmanagement changes.\nconditions\n\u2022 Data from credit reference agencies,\npress articles, and changes in\nexternal credit ratings\n\u2022 Quoted bond and credit default\nswap (CDS) prices for the borrower\nwhere available\n\u2022 Actual and expected significant\nchanges in the political, regulatory,\nand technological environment of\nthe borrower, or in its business\nactivities\ng) Generating the term structure for the Probability of Default (PD)\nCredit risk grades are a primary input into the determination of the term structure of PD for exposures. The Group\ncollects performance and default information about its credit risk exposures and analyzes the information by type\nof product and borrower as well as by credit risk grading. For some portfolios, information sourced from external\ncredit reference agencies is also used.\nPage | 84"

Credit and financial risk management \u2013 continued\nThe Group employs models developed based on the analysis of the data collected and generates estimates of\nthe remaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result of the passage of time\ndue to the impact of macro-economic factors. This analysis includes the identification and calibration of\nrelationships of portfolio default rates against macro-economic variables. For most exposures, key macro-\neconomic indicators include Real GDP, Government Expenditure and interest rate.\nBased on a variety of external actual and forecasted information, the Group formulates a base case view of the\nfuture direction of relevant economic variables as well as a representative range of other possible forecast\nscenarios. The Group then uses these forecasts to adjust its estimates of the PD term-structures. The range of\nPDs for corporate portfolio are as follow:\nInternal rating grade Internal rating 12 month\ndescription PD range\nPerforming\n1 Exceptional 0.01%-0.05%\n2 Excellent 0.06%- 0.13%\n3 Strong 0.14% -0.57%\n4 Good 0.58% - 2.56%\n5 Acceptable 2.57% -3.49%\n6 Marginal 3.50% -8.43%\n7 Special Mention 8.44%- 24.10%\nNon - Performing\n8 to 10 100%\nh) Determining whether credit risk has increased significantly\nWhen determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial\nrecognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without\nundue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the\nGroup\u2019s historical experience and credit assessments, including forward-looking information.\nThe criteria for determining whether credit risk has increased significantly varies by portfolio and includes\nquantitative as well as qualitative factors, including a backstop based on delinquency. One of the key quantitative\nindicators used by the Group is the relative downgrade of the internal rating of a borrower since origination and\nthereby the consequent change in the PD.\nUsing credit judgment and, where possible, relevant historical experience, the Group may also determine that an\nexposure has undergone a significant increase in credit risk based on particular qualitative indicators that it\nconsiders are indicative of such and for which the effect may not otherwise be fully reflected in its quantitative\nanalysis on a timely basis. The qualitative indicators include specific high risk rating grades, cross facility defaults,\nand renegotiation of loans to customers in financial difficulty (referred to as forbearance).\nAs a backstop, the Group considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an asset is\nmore than 29 days past due. Days past due are determined by counting the number of days since the earliest\nelapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not been received. Due dates are determined without\nconsidering any grace period that might be available to the borrower.\nThe Group monitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify significant increases in credit risk by regular\nreviews to confirm that:\n\u2022 the criteria are capable of identifying significant increases in credit risk before an exposure is in default;\n\u2022 the criteria do not align with the point in time when an asset becomes 30 days past due; and\n\u2022 there is no unwarranted volatility in the expected credit loss allowance resulting from transfers between 12-\nmonth PD (Stage 1) and lifetime PD (Stages 2 or 3).\nPage | 85"

Credit and financial risk management \u2013 continued\nThe Group uses three main components to measure ECL, which are Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at\nDefault (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD). The Group has leveraged existing regulatory practices and SAMA\nguidance to develop the methodology for model inputs which are adjusted when and where necessary to\ncomply with IFRS 9 requirements.\nFinancial assets and financial guarantee contracts reflecting a significant increase in credit risk are classified in\nStage 2 and the Group recognizes loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses,\nreflecting a lifetime expected PD that represents the probability of default over the remaining life of the financial\nasset. The allowances for Stage 2 are higher than for Stage 1, reflecting the impact of a longer time horizon\ncompared to a 12-month horizon used for the allowance in Stage 1.\ni) Definition of Default\nThe Group considers a financial asset to be in default when:\n\u2022 the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to\nactions such as realizing security (if any is held); or\n\u2022 the borrower is past due more than 90 days.\nOverdrafts are considered as being past due once the customer has breached an advised limit or has been\nadvised of a limit smaller than the current amount outstanding.\nIn assessing whether a borrower is in default the Group considers indicators that are:\n\u2022 qualitative, e.g. breaches of covenants;\n\u2022 quantitative, e.g. overdue status and non-payment of another obligation of the same borrower; and\n\u2022 based on data developed internally and obtained from external sources.\nInputs into the assessment of whether a financial instrument is in default and their significance may vary over\ntime to reflect changes in circumstances. IFRS 9 does not define the term \u2018default\u2019, but instead requires each\nentity to do so. For financial reporting, the Group has leveraged existing regulatory practices and SAMA definition\nof default which are adjusted when and where necessary to comply with IFRS 9 requirements.\nThe Group recognizes a loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, reflecting a PD of\n100% and recoverable cash flows on the asset. These financial assets are credit impaired and are classified under\nStage 3.\nj) Modified financial assets\nThe contractual terms of a loan may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market conditions,\ncustomer retention, and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the credit of the\ncustomer. An existing loan for which the terms have been modified may be derecognized and the renegotiated\nloan is recognized as a new loan at fair value in accordance with the Group\u2019s policies.\nThe Group may also renegotiate loans to customers in financial difficulty to maximize collection opportunities and\nminimize the risk of default. Loan forbearance is granted on a selective basis:\n\u2022 if there is a high risk of default; or\n\u2022 if there is evidence that the debtor made all reasonable efforts to pay under the original contractual terms\nand the debtor is expected to be able to meet the revised terms.\nPage | 86"

Credit and financial risk management \u2013 continued\nThe revised terms usually can include extending the maturity, changing the timing of commission and/or principal\npayments and amending the terms of loan covenants. Both retail and corporate loans are subject to the\nforbearance policy.\nFor financial assets modified, the estimate of PD reflects whether the modification has improved or restored the\nGroup\u2019s ability to collect special commission and principal and the Group's previous experience of similar\nforbearance action. As part of this process, the Group evaluates the borrower's payment performance against the\nmodified contractual terms and considers various behavioral indicators.\nGenerally, forbearance is a qualitative indicator of a significant increase in credit risk. A customer needs to\ndemonstrate consistently good payment behavior over a period of time before the PD is considered to have\ndecreased such that the loss allowance reverts to being measured at an amount equal to a 12-month ECL. The\nGroup considers a period of 12 months as a curing period to move assets from loss allowance measurement at\nLifetime ECL (Stage 2 and 3) to a 12-month ECL (Stage 1).\nk) Measurement of ECL\nThe key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the term structure of the following variables:\n\u2022 Probability of default (PD);\n\u2022 Loss given default (LGD); and\n\u2022 Exposure at default (EAD).\nThese parameters are generally derived from internally developed models and external benchmarks. They are\nadjusted to reflect forward-looking information as described above.\nPD estimates are estimates at a certain date, which are calculated based on internal rating models, and assessed using\nrating tools tailored to the various categories of counterparties and exposures. These models are based on internally\ncompiled data comprising both quantitative and qualitative factors. If a counterparty or exposure migrates between\nratings classes, then this can lead to a change in the estimate of the associated PD. PDs are estimated considering the\ncontractual maturities of exposures and estimated repayment rates.\nLGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Group estimates LGD parameters based on the history\nof recovery rates of claims against defaulted counterparties as well as external benchmarks. The LGD models consider\nthe structure, collateral, seniority of the claim, counterparty industry, and the net recovery amount of any collateral\nthat is integral to the financial asset.\nEAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Group derives the EAD from the current exposure\nto the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract including amortization.\nThe EAD of a financial asset is its gross carrying amount. For lending commitments and financial guarantees, the EAD\nincludes the amount drawn, as well as potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are\nestimated based on historical observations and forward-looking forecasts.\nAs described above and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for financial assets for which credit risk has not\nsignificantly increased, the Group measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period\n(including any borrower's extension options) over which it is exposed to credit risk, even if, for risk management\npurposes, the Group considers a longer period. The maximum contractual period extends to the date at which the\nGroup has the right to require repayment of an advance or terminate a loan commitment or financial guarantee.\nFor retail overdrafts and other facilities that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment component, the Group\nmeasures ECL over a period which may be longer than the maximum contractual period if the Group's contractual\nability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the Group's exposure to credit\nlosses to the contractual notice period. These facilities do not have a fixed term or repayment structure and are\nmanaged on a collective basis. The Group can cancel them with immediate effect. This contractual right may not be\nenforced in the normal day-to-day management but only when the Group becomes aware of an increase in credit risk\nat the facility level.\nPage | 87"

Credit and financial risk management \u2013 continued\nThis longer period is estimated taking into account the credit risk management actions that the Group expects to take\nand that serve to mitigate ECL. These can include a reduction in limits, or cancellation of the facility and/or turning the\noutstanding balance into a loan with fixed repayment terms.\nWhere modeling of a parameter is carried out on a collective basis, the financial instruments are grouped based on\nshared risk characteristics that include the instrument type, credit risk rating, time to maturity, collateral type,\nindustry; and geographic location of the borrower. Regular reviews are also conducted to ensure that exposures\nwithin a particular portfolio remain appropriately homogeneous.\nFor portfolios where the Group has limited historical data, external benchmark information is used to supplement\nthe internally available data.

This process involves developing two or more additional economic scenarios and considering the relative\nprobabilities of each outcome. External information includes economic data and forecasts published by governmental\nbodies and monetary authorities and selected private sector forecasters.\nThe current scenario represents a most likely outcome and is aligned with information used by the Group for other\npurposes such as strategic planning and budgeting. The other scenarios represent more optimistic and more\npessimistic outcomes. Periodically, the Group carries out stress testing of more extreme shocks to calibrate its\ndetermination of these other representative scenarios.\nPredicted relationships between the key indicators and default and loss rates on the portfolios of financial assets and\nfinancial guarantee contracts have been developed based on analyzing historical data from 2013 onwards.\nThe group has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each portfolio of financial\ninstruments and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macro-economic variables\nand credit risk and credit losses.

These securities are generally unquoted. In the absence of a quoted price in an active\nmarket, these securities are valued using observable inputs such as yield information for similar instruments or last\nexecuted transaction prices in securities of the same issuer or based on indicative market quotes. Adjustments are also\nconsidered as part of the valuations when necessary to account for the different features of the instruments including\ndifference in tenors. Because the significant inputs for these investments are observable, the Bank categorizes these\ninvestments within Level 2.\nLevel 2 derivative financial instruments include various derivatives contracts including forward foreign exchange\ncontracts, commission rate options, and commission rate swaps. These derivatives are valued using widely recognized\nvaluation models. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include the use of forward pricing standard\nmodels using present value calculations and well-recognized Black - Scholes option pricing models. These models\nincorporate various market observable inputs including foreign exchange rates, forward rates, and yield curves, and\nare therefore included within Level 2.\nLevel 3 investments include private equity funds and certain unquoted strategic investments in equities. These\nsecurities are generally not quoted in an active market, and therefore are valued using indicative market quotes from\nan issuer / counter-party or valued at cost in the absence of any such alternative reliable indicative estimate.\nPage | 102"

Fair values of financial assets and liabilities - continued\nLevel 3 derivative financial instruments include the embedded derivative put option arising from the existing master\nagreement entered into by the Bank relating to its investment in an associated company (see note 11e). For purposes of\ndetermining the fair value of the put option, the Bank uses a well-recognized and frequently used Binomial Option\nPricing Model. This model requires certain inputs which are not observable in the current market place. Certain inputs\nare specifically stated within the master agreement with the associated company. Other inputs are based on the\nhistorical results of the associated company. These other inputs may require management\u2019s judgement including\nestimations about the future results of the associated company, the detrimental effects on the operating results of the\nassociated company which may arise from an exercise of the option, and an estimate of the fair value of the underlying\ninvestment. Several of the inputs are also interdependent.\nShould the significant estimations of inputs vary by plus or minus ten percent, the fair value could increase or decrease\nby approximately SAR 29.5 million (2023: SAR 11.8 million ) due to estimating operating results of the associated\ncompany, and could increase or decrease by approximately SAR 18.6 million (2023: SAR 10.1 million) due to estimating\nthe detrimental effects on the operating results of the associated company which may arise from an exercise of the\noption, and could increase or decrease by approximately SAR 28.4 million (2023: SAR 14.9 million) due to estimating the\nfair value of the underlying investment.\nIn all respects, the Group\u2019s significant estimates are based on experience and judgement relevant to each input, and in\nall cases, due care is taken to ensure that the inputs are prudent to ensure that the estimation of fair value is reasonable\nin the circumstances.

Derivative financial instruments\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Group utilises the following derivative financial instruments for both trading and hedging purposes:\nSwaps\nSwaps are commitments to exchange one set of cash flows for another. For commission rate swaps, counterparties generally exchange\nfixed and floating rate commission payments in a single currency without exchanging principal. For currency swaps, fixed commission\npayments and principal are exchanged in different currencies. For cross-currency commission rate swaps, principal, fixed and floating\ncommission payments are exchanged in different currencies.\nForwards and futures\nForwards and futures are contractual agreements to either buy or sell a specified currency, commodity or financial instrument at a specified\nprice on a date in the future. Forwards are customised contracts transacted in the over-the-counter market.\nForeign currency and commission rate futures are transacted in standardised amounts on regulated exchanges with changes in fair values\nsettled daily.\nForward rate agreements\nForward rate agreements are individually negotiated commission rate contracts that call for the cash settlement, on a specified future date\nor series of dates, of the difference between the contracted commission rate and the market rate calculated on a notional principal.\nOptions\nOptions are contractual agreements under which the seller (writer) grants the purchaser (holder) the right, but not the obligation, to either\nbuy or sell, on a fixed future date or at any time during a specified period, a specified amount of a currency, commodity or financial\ninstrument at a pre-determined price.\nHeld for trading purposes\nMost of the Group\u2019s derivative trading activities relate to sales, positioning and arbitrage. Sales activities involve offering products to\ncustomers and banks in order to, inter alia, enable them to transfer, modify or reduce current and future risks. Positioning involves\nmanaging market risk positions with the expectation of profiting from favorable movements in prices, rates or indices. Arbitrage involves\nidentifying, with the expectation of profiting from price differentials between markets or products.\nHeld for hedging purposes\nThe Group has adopted a comprehensive system for the measurement and management of risk. Part of the risk management process\ninvolves managing the Group\u2019s exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and commission rates to reduce its exposure to currency and\ncommission rate risks to acceptable levels as determined by the Board of Directors (the Board) within the guidelines issued by SAMA.\n39"

Positions\nare monitored on a daily basis and hedging strategies are used to ensure positions are maintained within the set limits. The Board of\nDirectors has established the level of commission rate risk by setting limits on commission rate gaps for stipulated periods. Asset and\nliability commission rate gaps are reviewed on a periodic basis and hedging strategies are used to reduce commission rate gap to be within\nthe set limits.\nAs part of its asset and liability management, the Group uses derivatives for hedging purposes in order to adjust its exposure to currency\nand commission rate risks to acceptable levels. This is generally achieved by hedging specific transactions as well as strategic hedging\nagainst overall statement of financial position exposures. Strategic hedging, other than portfolio hedges for commission rate risk, do not\nqualify for hedge accounting and related derivatives are accounted for as held for trading.\nThe Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps to hedge against specifically identified currency risks. In addition,\nthe Group uses commission rate swaps and commission rate futures to hedge against commission rate risk arising from specifically\nidentified fixed commission rate exposures.\nThe Group also uses commission rate swaps to hedge against the cash flow risk arising on certain floating rate exposures. In all such\ncases, the hedging relationship and objective, including details of the hedged items and hedging instrument are formally documented and\nthe transactions are accounted for as either fair value or cash flow hedges.\n11.1 Cash flow hedges\nThe Group is exposed to variability in future commission cash flows on non-trading assets which bear commission income at a variable\nrate. The Group uses commission rate swaps as cash flow hedges to hedge these commission rate risks. The below table indicating, the\nperiods when the hedged cash flows are expected to occur and when they are expected to affect statement of income:\n2024 Within 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years Over 5 years\nCash inflows (assets) 141,988 33,544 - -\nCash out flows (liabilities) (94,329) (21,794) - -\nNet cash flow 47,659 11,750 - -\n2023 Within 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years Over 5 years\nCash inflows (assets) 46,586 58,218 - -\nCash out flows (liabilities) (101,793) (94,893) - -\nNet cash flow (55,207) (36,675) - -\n40"

Cash requirements under\nguarantees and standby letters of credit are considerably less than the amount of the commitment because the Group does not generally\nexpect the third party to draw funds under the agreement.\nDocumentary letters of credit, which are written undertakings by the Group on behalf of a customer authorising a third party to draw\ndrafts on the Group up to a stipulated amount under specific terms and conditions, are generally collateralised by the underlying shipments\nof goods to which they relate, and therefore have significantly less risk.\nAcceptances comprise undertakings by the Group to pay bills of exchange drawn on customers. The Group expects most acceptances to\nbe presented before being reimbursed by the customers.\nCommitments to extend credit represent the unused portion of authorisations to extend credit, principally in the form of loans and\nadvances, guarantees and letters of credit. With respect to credit risk on commitments to extend credit, the Group is potentially exposed\nto a loss in an amount equal to the total unused commitments. However, the likely amount of loss, which cannot readily be quantified, is\nexpected to be considerably less than the total unused commitment as most commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers\nmaintaining specific credit standards. The below mentioned commitments and contingences are callable on demand of the counter-party.\nFurthermore, the total outstanding commitments to extend credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, as many of these\ncommitments could expire or terminate without being funded.\n19.3.1 The Group\u2019s commitments and contingencies is as follows:\n2024 2023\nLetters of credit 5,899,143 5,532,713\nLetters of guarantee 32,268,297 25,049,118\nAcceptances 2,061,217 1,567,174\nIrrevocable commitments to extend credit 9,840,260 5,835,479\nOther 9,750 9,750\nTotal 50,078,667 37,994,234\nThe unutilised portion of non-firm commitments for commercial and corporate loans as at December 31,2024, which can be revoked\nunilaterally at any time by the Group, amounts to SAR 26.66 billion (2023: SAR 24.63 billion).\n19.3.2 The analysis of commitments and contingencies by counter-party is as follows:\n2024 2023\nCorporate 46,418,195 33,334,540\nBanks and other financial institutions 3,103,584 2,935,082\nOther 556,888 1,724,612\nTotal 50,078,667 37,994,234\n47"

Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counter-party may not settle an obligation for full value, either when due or at any time thereafter.\nThis risk arises from the potential that a customer or counter-party is either unwilling to perform an obligation or its ability to perform\nsuch an obligation is impaired, resulting in an economic loss to the Group. The Group is exposed to credit risk when its business units\nextend credit to counterparties. The Group\u2019s Executive Committee (ExCom)/ Board of Directors provides oversight of Credit Risk through\nthe documented Credit Policy.\nThe enterprise-wide requirements for identification, assessment, monitoring and reporting of credit risk is set by the Risk Management\nGroup, while business/support units are accountable for the credit risks within their respective areas, aligning business strategies with\nGroup\u2019s risk appetite.\nCredit Risk policies and procedures are established to provide control of credit portfolios through periodic assessment of the credit standing\nof borrowers and quantifying maximum permissible exposures to specific borrowers. Such individuals and/or groups exposures are\nmonitored periodically on a portfolio basis. The Group\u2019s Credit Policy provides detailed guidelines to manage credit risk effectively; it is\nreviewed and updated from time to time based on experience, emerging issues, best market practices and directives from regulatory\nauthorities. The Credit Policy is designed to ensure clear recognition of credit risk management strategies and objectives, which, inter-\nalia, include:\n- Strengthening and enhancing Group's ability to measure and mitigate credit risks on pre-emptive basis to minimise credit losses.\n- Strengthening and enhancing credit portfolio management process.\n- Strengthening and enhancing Group's systems and procedures for early problem recognition.\n- Compliance with local regulatory requirement and industry\u2019s best practices for credit risk management.\nThe Credit Policy addresses all functions and activities related to the credit process including the underwriting criteria. It stipulates Group\u2019s\nappetite for risk, which, inter-alia, provides guidance on the target markets (Corporate, Commercial/ Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs),\nConsumer and High Net-Worth Individuals) and desirable type of borrowers/industries. Some criteria are product-specific and are governed\nby individual credit product policies, while others generally include credit quality standards, purpose and terms of facilities, undesirable\nloans, credit analysis, concentrations of credit, repayment ability, compliance with laws & regulations, expected losses and documentation.\n32.1 Portfolio Monitoring\nPortfolio management is ensured through diversification of the credit portfolio on the basis of tenor, industries/business segments, risk\ngrades and geographical areas to avoid the risk of over-exposure to certain economic sectors/credit products, which might be impacted\nby unfavorable developments in the economy. The Group broadly uses borrower and sector criteria for mitigating concentration risk. The\nGroup\u2019s business is predominantly concentrated in Saudi Arabia, minimising cross-currency risk although geographical concentration\nremains but this is considered acceptable and within Group\u2019s risk appetite.\nConsumer banking portfolio is a diversified one since relatively small exposures are approved to a large number of individuals, based\nmainly on assignment of salary or security with exposure caps on products/ employers, etc.\n32.2 Risk Measurement and Reporting System\nCredit Risk tracks trends and identifies weaknesses in the quality of corporate, commercial, retail and private banking loans portfolio by\nemploying:\n- Obligor and facility risk rating system to assess the quality of obligor and riskiness of facilities; and\n- Periodic reviews and reporting of aggregate statistics on asset diversification and credit quality for key segments of the portfolio.\nRating system is established with the objective to:\n- place the responsibility on business units to regularly evaluate credit risk on exposures and identify problems within their portfolios;\n- establish early warning signals for detecting deterioration in credit quality;\n- set standards for business units to submit their inputs on problematic exposures; and\n- provide guidelines to respond and take remedial actions as soon as deterioration in credit quality is detected.\nThe Group classifies its exposures into 13 risk categories, of which 10 are for performing obligors and 3 are for non-performing obligors.\nA rating is assigned to a borrower through a system-based methodology that takes into account financial and non-financial information,\ntranslating into a grade and Probability of Default (PD) for the relationship.\n56"

These reports are comprehensive, have wide scope and address several issues including:\n- Portfolio quality, industry concentration and large exposures;\n- Product concentration, credit monitoring and concentration of shares held by the Group as collateral; and\n- Past due follow-up, customer-provisioning details and provision movement.\nRetail portfolio comprises of personal loans, credit cards, housing loans and auto leasing.\nIndividual customers are assessed on the basis of standardised pre-set criteria for specific schemes to assess eligibility for each of the\nabove products. Delinquent customers, based on days past due (bucket-wise), are classified as non-performing.\nFor the retail portfolio, personal loans are granted against salary assignments to borrowers who are employees of approved list of\nacceptable employers, mainly government and quasi-government employees. The main criteria for lending to this portfolio include\napproved employer, minimum salary requirements, length of service and pre-specified Debt Service Ratio (DSR). Housing loan and auto\nleasing products are considered generally secured since the underlying assets are owned by the Group and leased to customers in the\ncase of auto loans, or mortgaged to the Group in the case of housing loans, thus mitigating risk to a large extent, housing loans are also\ninsured against mortality, permanent disability and damages to property.\nThe Group has developed application score-cards and behavior score-cards, using internal and external data, to evaluate, monitor and\ncontrol consumer credits as this is expected to go a long way in making consumer credit risk management more effective and efficient.\n32.3 Asset Quality\nCorporate and commercial exposures are considered non-performing in the following circumstances:\n- The principal of loan or interest payment remains past due more than 90 days after its due date;\n- The outstanding of an overdraft remains in excess of approved limit for more than 90 days or the overdraft account is in-active for\nmore than 180 days.\nNon-performing exposures migrate across the non-performing risk grades (substandard, doubtful and loss) according to their days past\ndue and/or deterioration in credit quality.\nIn determining whether a corporate exposure has become impaired, the Group makes judgements as to whether there is any observable\ndata indicating decrease in the estimated future cash flows. This evidence may include an indication that there has been an adverse\nchange in the payment status of borrowers. Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for loans with similar credit\nrisk characteristics, when estimating the cash flows.\nThe methodology and assumptions used for estimating both, the amount and timing of future cash flows, are reviewed regularly to reduce\nany differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.\nConsumer exposures are considered non-performing if payment remains past due more than 90 days after its due date.\n57"

This includes both quantitative\nand qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and expert credit assessment and including forward-\nlooking information.\nNo change has been made in the backstop criteria for all types of exposures.\n32.4.4 Credit risk grades\nThe Group allocates credit risk grades to each exposure based on a variety of variables that is determined to be predictive of the risk of\ndefault and applying experienced credit judgements. Credit risk grades are defined using qualitative and quantitative factors that are\nindicative of risk of default. These factors vary depending on the nature of the exposure and the type of borrower.\nCredit risk grades are defined and calibrated such that the risk of default occurring increases significantly as the credit risk deteriorates\nso, for example, the difference in risk of default between credit risk grades 1 and 2 is smaller than the difference between credit risk\ngrades 8 and 9.\nThe 12 months PIT PD for the exposures in grade 1 to 8 ranges from 0.25% to 4.59%. The 12 months PIT PD for grade 9 and 10 (watch\nlist) goes up to 23.49%.\nCredit risk grade or score is allocated to each exposure at initial recognition based on available information about the borrower. Exposures\nare subject to ongoing monitoring, which may result in an exposure being moved to a different credit risk grade or score. The monitoring\nof exposures involves use of the following data:\nCorporate exposures Retail exposures\nInformation obtained during periodic review of customer files - e.g., Internally collected data and customer behaviour data - e.g.,\naudited financial statements, management accounts, budgets and utilisation of credit card facilities\nprojections. Examples of areas of particular focus are: gross profit\nmargins, financial leverage ratios, debt service coverage,\ncompliance with covenants, quality of management, senior\nmanagement changes etc\nData from credit reference agencies, press articles, changes in Affordability metrics\nexternal credit ratings\nQuoted bond and credit default swap (CDS) prices for the borrower External data from credit reference agencies; including default\nwhere available. information\nActual and expected significant changes in the political, regulatory\nand technological environment of the borrower or in its business\nactivities\n61"

The Group collects performance and\ndefault information about its credit risk exposures analyzed by type of product and borrower as well as by credit risk grading. For retail\nportfolios, SIMAH information is also used.\nThe Group employs statistical models to analyze the data collected and generate estimates of the remaining lifetime PD of exposures and\nhow these are expected to change over a period of time.\nThis analysis includes the identification and calibration of relationships between changes in default rates and macro-economic factors. For\nmost exposures, key macro-economic indicators include Oil Price, GDP growth, Government Expenditures, Share Price Index and\nEmployment.\nBased on the available economic data and consideration of a variety of external actual and forecast information, the Group formulates a\n'base case' view of the future direction of relevant economic variables as well as a representative range of other possible forecast scenarios.\nThe Group then uses these forecasts to adjust its estimates of PDs.\n32.4.6 Determining whether credit risk has increased significantly\nThe criteria for determining whether credit risk has increased significantly vary by portfolio and include quantitative changes in PDs and a\nbackstop based on delinquency.\nUsing its expert credit judgements and, where possible, relevant historical experience, the Group may determine that an exposure has\nundergone a significant increase in credit risk based on particular qualitative indicators that it considers are indicative of such and whose\neffect may not otherwise be fully reflected in its quantitative analysis on a timely basis.\nThe assessment of significant increase in credit risk, is assessed taking on account of:\n- Days past due;\n- change in probability of default by 150% occurring since initial recognition for retail portfolio;\n- downgrade in obligor risk rating of 2 or more notches for wholesale portfolio expected life of the financial instrument; and\n- reasonable and supportable information, that is available without undue cost or effort that may affect credit risk.\nLifetime expected credit losses are recognised against any material facility which has experienced significant increase in credit risk since\ninitial recognition. Recognition of lifetime expected credit losses will be made if any facility is past due for 30 days or more. The Group\nmonitors the effectiveness of the criteria used to identify significant increases in credit risk by regular reviews to confirm that:\n- the criteria are capable of identifying significant increases in credit risk before an exposure is in default; and\n- there is no unwarranted volatility in loss allowance from transfers between 12-month PD (stage 1) and lifetime PD (stage 2).\nAs a backstop, the Group considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an asset is more than 30 days past\ndue. Days past due are determined by counting the number of days since the earliest elapsed due date when full payment became due.\n32.4.7 Modified financial assets\nThe contractual terms of a loan may be modified for several reasons, including changing market conditions, customer retention and other\nfactors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration of the customer. An existing loan whose terms have been modified may\nbe derecognised and the renegotiated loan recognised as a new loan at fair value in accordance with the accounting policy.\nWhen the terms of a financial asset are modified and the modification does not result in de-recognition, the determination of whether the\nasset's credit risk has increased significantly reflects comparison of:\n- its remaining Net Present Value (NPV) of the cash-flows at the reporting date based on the modified terms; with\n- the remaining NPV of the cash-flows calculated based on data at initial recognition and the original contractual terms.\nThe Group renegotiates loans to customers in financial difficulties to maximise collection opportunities and minimise the risk of default. As\nper Group's policy, loan restructuring is granted on a selective basis if the debtor is currently in default on its debt or if there is a high risk\nof default, there is evidence that the debtor made all reasonable efforts to pay under the original contractual terms and the debtor is\nexpected to be able to meet the revised terms.\nThe revised terms usually include extending the maturity, changing the timing of interest payments and amending the terms of loan\ncovenants. Both retail and corporate loans are subject to the restructuring policy.\n62"

As part of this\nprocess, the Group evaluates the borrower's payment performance against the modified contractual terms and considers various behavioral\nindicators.\nGenerally, restructuring is a qualitative indicator of a significant increase in credit risk and an expectation of restructuring may constitute\nevidence that an exposure is credit-impaired /in default. A customer needs to demonstrate consistently good payment behavior over a\nperiod of time before the exposure is no longer considered to be credit-impaired/ in default or the PD is considered to have decreased\nsuch that the loss allowance reverts to being measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.\n32.4.8 Definition of \u2018Default\u2019\nThe following criteria are used to determine obligor default, if the obligor:\n- has an obligation which is 90 (or more) days past due;\n- has an obligation for which the Group has stopped accruing interest;\n- has obligation(s) that has/have been restructured with loss to the Group;\n- has an obligation that is classified as non-performing by the Group; and\n- has an obligation that the Group has charged off in part or in full.\nIn assessing whether a borrower is in default, the Group considers indicators that are:\n- Qualitative - e.g., breaches of covenant;\n- Quantitative - e.g., overdue status and non-payment on another obligation of the same issuer to the Group;\n- based on data developed internally and obtained from external sources; and\n- inputs to the assessment of whether a financial instrument is in default and their significance may vary over time to reflect changes\nin circumstances.\nThe definition of default largely aligns with that applied by the Group for regulatory capital purposes.\n32.4.9 Incorporation of forward-looking information\nThe Group incorporates forward-looking information into both its assessment of whether the credit risk of an instrument has increased\nsignificantly since its initial recognition and its measurement of ECL. Based on consideration of a variety of actual and forecast information,\nthe Group formulates a 'base case' view of the future direction of relevant economic variables as well as a representative range of other\npossible forecast scenarios. This process involves developing two or more additional economic scenarios and considering the relative\nprobabilities of each outcome. External information includes economic data and forecasts provided by agencies, such as Moody\u2019s Economic\nData services.\nThe base case represents a most-likely outcome and is aligned with information used by the Group for other purposes such as strategic\nplanning and budgeting. The other scenarios represent more optimistic and pessimistic outcomes.\nThe Group has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each portfolio using an analysis of historical data\nand estimated relationships between macro-economic variables and credit risk and credit losses. The economic scenarios used included\nthe following weightages ranges of key indicators:\nEconomic Indicators 2024 2023\nUpside 25% Upside 25%\nGDP Base case 30% Base case 30%\nDownside 45% Downside 45%\nUpside 25% Upside 25%\nBrent oil prices Base case 30% Base case 30%\nDownside 45% Downside 45%\nUpside 25% Upside 25%\nTadawul all shares index Base case 30% Base case 30%\nDownside 45% Downside 45%\n63"

    "text": "arab national bank - Consolidated Financial Statements\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nAs at and for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023\nAll amounts in thousands of Saudi Riyals unless stated otherwise\nPD estimates are estimates at a certain date, which are calculated, based on statistical rating models, and assessed using rating tools\ntailored to the various categories of counterparties and exposures. These statistical models are based on internally and externally compiled\ndata comprising both quantitative and qualitative factors. Where it is available, market data may also be used to derive the PD for large\ncorporate counterparties. If a counterparty or exposure migrates between rating classes, then this will lead to a change in the estimate of\nthe associated PD.\nLGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Group estimates LGD parameters based on the history of recovery rates\nof claims against defaulted counterparties. The LGD models consider the structure, collateral and recovery costs of any collateral that is\nintegral to the financial asset. For secured retail loans, asset value/ type is a key parameter in determining LGD. LGD estimates are\nrecalibrated for different economic scenarios. They are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using the effective interest rate as the\ndiscounting factor.\nEAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Group derives the EAD from the current exposure to the counterparty\nand potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract including amortisation. The EAD of a financial asset is its gross\ncarrying amount. For lending commitments and financial guarantees, the EAD includes the amount drawn, as well as potential future\namounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated based on historical observations and forward-looking forecasts. For\nsome financial assets, EAD is determined by modeling the range of possible exposure outcomes at various points in time using scenario\nand statistical techniques.\nAs described above and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for financial assets for which credit risk has not significantly\nincreased, the Group measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period (including any borrower's\nextension options) over which it is exposed to credit risk, even if, for risk management purposes, the Group considers a longer period.\nThe maximum contractual period extends to the date at which the Group has the right to require repayment of an advance or terminate\na loan commitment or guarantee.\nHowever, for overdrafts and credit card facilities that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment component, the Group measures\nECL over a period longer than the maximum contractual period if the Group's contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the\nundrawn commitment does not limit the Group's exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. These facilities do not have a\nfixed term or repayment structure and are managed on a collective basis. The Group can cancel them with immediate effect; however this\ncontractual right is not enforced in the normal day-to-day management but only when the Group becomes aware of significant increase\nin credit risk at the facility level, prompting such action. This longer period is estimated considering the credit risk management actions\nthat the Group expects to take and that serve to mitigate ECL. These include a reduction in limits cancellation of the facility and/or turning\nthe outstanding balance into a loan with fixed repayment terms.\n32.4.12 Sensitivity of ECL allowance\nThe table below illustrates the sensitivity of ECL to key factors used in determining it as at the year-end:\nStatement of income impact (absolute values)\nAssumptions sensitised 2024 2023\nChanges in Macro-economic factors while other assumptions kept constant:\nDecrease/ increase in Oil price by 1% 7,050 6,498\nDecrease/ increase in GDP by 1% 39,611 51,037\nDecrease/ increase in Tadawul all shares index by 1% 4,327 3,566\nScenario weightages:\nBase scenario sensitised by - 5% with corresponding change in downside 36,582 32,474\nBase scenario increases by + 5% with corresponding change in upside 6,200 3,474\n65"

Market risk\nMarket Risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market variables\nsuch as commission rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices. The Group classifies exposures to market risk into either trading,\nnon-trading or banking-book.\n33.1 Market risk - trading book\nThe Board of Directors has set limits for the acceptable level of risk in managing the trading book. To manage market risk in the trading\nbook, the Group periodically applies a VaR (Value at Risk) methodology to assess the market risk positions held and to estimate the\npotential economic loss based on a set of parameters and assumptions regarding changes in market conditions.\nA VaR methodology estimates the potential negative change in market value of a portfolio at a given confidence level and over a specified\ntime horizon. The Group uses risk models to assess the possible changes in the market value of the trading book based on historical data.\nVaR models are usually designed to measure the market risk in a normal market environment and therefore the use thereof has limitations\ndue to it being based on historical correlations and volatilities in market prices and assumes that the future movements will follow a\nstatistical distribution.\nThe VaR that the Group measures is an estimate, using a confidence level of 99% of the potential loss that is not expected to be exceeded\nif the current market positions were to be held unchanged for one day. The use of 99% confidence level depicts that within a one-day\nhorizon, losses exceeding VaR should occur, on average, not more than once every hundred days.\nThe VaR represents the market risk in a portfolio at the close of a business day. It does not account for any losses that may occur beyond\nthe defined confidence interval. Actual trading results can, however, differ from the VaR calculations. VaR does not provide a meaningful\nindication of profits and losses in stressed market conditions.\nAlthough VaR is an important tool for measuring market risk, the assumptions on which the model is based do give rise to some limitations,\nincluding the following:\n- A 1-day holding period assumes that it is possible to hedge or dispose of positions within a one day horizon. This is considered to be\na realistic assumption in most cases but may not be true in situations where there is severe market liquidity for a prolonged period.\n- A 99 percent confidence level does not reflect losses that may occur beyond this level. Even within the model used there is a one\npercent probability that losses could exceed VaR.\n- VaR is calculated on an end of day basis and does not reflect exposures that may arise on positions during the trading day.\n- VaR is dependent upon the Group's position and the volatility of market prices. The VaR of an unchanged position reduces if the\nmarket price volatility declines and vice versa.\nThe limitations of VaR are recognised by supplementing the VaR limits with other position and sensitivity limit structures, including limits\nto address potential concentration risks within each trading portfolio. In addition, the Group carries out stress testing on its trading book\nto simulate conditions outside normal confidence intervals. The potential losses occurring under stress test conditions are reported regularly\nto the Bank\u2019s Asset and Liabilities Committee (ALCO) for review.\n69"

The Board of Directors has established commission rate gap limits for stipulated periods. The Group monitors\npositions daily and uses hedging strategies to ensure positions are maintained within the established gap limits.\nThe following table shows the sensitivity of the Group\u2019s consolidated statement of income and equity to a reasonable possible change in\ncommission rates, with other variables held constant. Income sensitivity arises from the impact of assumed changes in commission rates\non net special commission income for one year, based on floating rate non-trading financial assets and liabilities held as at year end, after\ntaking into account the effect of hedging. Equity sensitivity is calculated by revaluing fixed rate FVOCI/ FVOCI financial assets, including\nthe effect of any associated hedges for the effect of assumed changes in commission rates. The sensitivity of equity is analyzed by maturity\nof the asset or swap.\nBanking book exposures are monitored and analyzed in their respective currencies and relevant sensitivities are disclosed in SAR million\nas follows:\n2024\nCurrency Increase/ (decrease) Sensitivity of net Sensitivity of equity\nspecial commission Total\nin basis points income 6 months or less 1 year or less 1-5 years or less Over 5 years\nSAR +10 (2.36) (0.06) - (0.32) - (0.38)\nUSD +10 (2.45) (0.02) (2.16) (34.26) (8.31) (44.75)\nOthers +10 0.63 - - - - -\nSAR -10 2.36 0.06 - 0.32 - 0.38\nUSD -10 2.45 0.02 2.16 34.26 8.31 44.75\nOthers -10 (0.63) - - - - -\n70"

The Group is exposed to\ncommission rate risk as a result of mismatches or gaps in the amounts of financial assets and liabilities and derivatives, credit related\ncommitment and contingencies that mature or re-price in a given period. The Group manages this risk by matching the re-pricing of assets\nand liabilities through risk management strategies.\n71"

Foreign\ncurrency risk exposures that arise in the banking book are transferred to the trading book and are managed as part of the trading portfolio.\nThe Board sets various types of currency risk limits that are monitored daily, including position, stop-loss and VaR limits.\nThe table below shows the currencies to which the Group has a significant exposure as at year end, on its non-trading monetary assets\nand liabilities and forecasted cash flows. The analysis calculates the effect of reasonable possible movement of the currency rate against\nSAR with all other variables held constant, on the consolidated statement of income (due to changes in fair values of currency sensitive\nnon-trading monetary assets and liabilities) and equity (due to changes in fair values of currency swaps used as cash flow hedges). A\npositive effect shows a potential increase in the consolidated statement of income or equity whereas, a negative effect shows a potential\nnet reduction in the consolidated statement of income or equity, and are disclosed in SAR million as per the below table:\n2024 2023\nChanges in currency Effect on net Changes in currency Effect on net\nCurrency risk exposures\nrate in % income rate in % Income\n+5 (87.786) +5 (2.480)\nUS Dollar\n-5 87.786 -5 2.480\n+3 0.031 +3 0.051\nEuro\n-3 (0.031) -3 (0.051)\n+3 0.003 +3 (0.577)\nPound Sterling\n-3 (0.003) -3 0.577\n33.2.4 Currency position\nThe Group manages exposure to the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on its financial position and cash flows. The\nBoard sets limits on the level of exposure by currency and in total for both overnight and intra-day positions. These limits are monitored\ndaily. At the end of the year, the Group had the following significant net exposures denominated in foreign currencies:\nLong (short) Long (short)\n2024 2023\nUS Dollar (1,755,718) (49,601)\nEuro 1,039 1,703\nPound Sterling 101 (19,244)\n33.2.5 Equity price risk\nEquity p rice risk refers to the risk of a decrease in the fair values of equities in the non-trading investment portfolio as a result of reasonable\npossible changes in levels of equity indices and the value of individual stocks.

Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its net funding requirements. Liquidity risk can be caused by market\ndisruptions or credit downgrades, which may cause certain sources of funding to dry up suddenly. To mitigate this risk, management has\ndiversified funding sources, manages assets with liquidity in mind and maintains a healthy balance of cash, cash equivalents and readily\nmarketable securities.\nIn accordance with the Banking Control Law and the regulations issued by SAMA, the Group maintains a statutory deposit with SAMA\nequal to 7% (2023: 7%) of total demand deposits and 4% (2023: 4%) of saving and time deposits. In addition to the statutory deposit,\nthe Group also maintains liquid reserves of no less than 20% of its deposit liabilities, in the form of cash, Saudi Government debt\ninstruments or assets that can be converted into cash within 30 days.\nThe Group has the ability to raise additional funds through repo facilities with SAMA mainly against debt instruments issued by Saudi\ncompanies or Saudi government.\n34.1 Analysis of undiscounted financial liabilities by remaining contractual maturities\nThe table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted repayment\nobligations. As special commission payments up to contractual maturity are included in the table, totals do not match with the consolidated\nstatement of financial position. The contractual maturities of liabilities have been determined based on the remaining period at the reporting\ndate to the contractual maturity date and do not take into account the effective expected maturities. The Group expects that many\ncustomers will not request repayment on the earliest date the Group could be required to pay and the table does not affect the expected\ncash flows indicated by the Group's deposit retention history.\n2024 Within 3 months 3-12 months 1-5 years Above 5 years No fixed maturity Total\nFinancial liabilities\nDue to banks, SAMA and other\n10,411,882 3,883,172 - - 162,151 14,457,205\nfinancial institutions\nCustomers\u2019 deposits 62,040,691 17,880,147 2,842,820 - 100,562,494 183,326,152\nIssued Sukuk 16,402 93,544 305,833 2,906,051 - 3,321,830\nOther liabilities\nAccrued expenses and accounts\n- - - - 7,987,131 7,987,131\npayable\nTotal financial liabilities 72,468,975 21,856,863 3,148,653 2,906,051 108,711,776 209,092,318\n2023 Within 3 months 3-12 months 1-5 years Above 5 years No fixed maturity Total\nFinancial liabilities\nDue to banks, SAMA and other\n2,954,699 1,755,053 3,586,902 - 175,963 8,472,617\nfinancial institutions\nCustomers\u2019 deposits 64,795,364 12,585,131 1,110,410 - 88,226,870 166,717,775\nIssued Sukuk 16,402 77,398 374,432 2,999,595 - 3,467,827\nOther liabilities\nAccrued expenses and accounts\n- - - - 6,107,102 6,107,102\npayable\nTotal financial liabilities 67,766,465 14,417,582 5,071,744 2,999,595 94,509,935 184,765,321\nDue to banks, SAMA and other financial institutions and Customers\u2019 deposits under no fixed maturity are callable on demand.\n75"

Fair values of assets and liabilities\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or\ntransfer the liability takes place in either:\n- The accessible principal market for the asset or liability; or\n- The absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous accessible market for the asset or liability.\n- The fair values of on-consolidated statement of financial position for assets and liabilities are not significantly different from their\ncarrying amounts included in the consolidated financial statements.\nDetermination of fair value and fair value hierarchy. The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value\nof assets and liabilities:\nLevel 1: quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e., without modification or repacking);\nLevel 2: quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are\nbased on observable market data; and\nLevel 3: valuation techniques for which any significant inputs are not based on observable market data.\n77"

Investment management services\nThe Group offers investment services to its customers, which include management of investment funds with assets totaling SAR 15,614\nmillion (2023: SAR 12,208 million).\nThe financial statements of these funds are not consolidated with these consolidated financial statements, as the Group is not significantly\nexposed to variability of return and hence do not qualify to be considered as a subsidiary. However, the Group\u2019s share of these non-\nconsolidated funds is included in FVSI investments and fees earned are disclosed under related party transactions.\nAssets held in trust or in a fiduciary capacity are not treated as assets of the Group and accordingly are not included in these consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n39. Subsequent events\n39.1 Tier 1 Sukuk\nOn January 13, 2025, the bank announced its intention to issue a Saudi Riyal denominated additional tier 1 capital sukuk by way of private\nplacement in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia pursuant to its SAR 11,250 million additional tier 1 capital sukuk programme.\nOn February 4, 2025, the bank announced the completion of the offer of the Sukuk, the value of the offer is SAR 3,350 million.\n39.2 Cash dividends\nOn February 5, 2025, the Board of Directors approved to pay cash dividends of SAR 1.3 billion for the second half of 2024 after deducting\nzakat. This final dividend will result in a net payment of SAR 0.65 per share to Saudi shareholders. Upon distribution, the income tax\nliability of the non-Saudi strategic shareholder for the current and prior period (if any) will be deducted from their share of the dividend.\nThis final dividend will be distributed on February 19, 2025.\n40. Comparative figures\nCertain prior year figures have been corrected to conform with current year presentation, which are not material in nature to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, management identified certain historic holdings in equity investments by the Group which had\nnot previously been recorded. These investments have been accounted for in the current year and been classified as Investments at FVSI.\nThe Group management has rectified this in respect of the comparative period by restating the consolidated financial statements lines as\nfollows:\nPreviously presented Restatement restated\nAs at December 31, 2023\nInvestments, net 46,675,830 738,862 47,414,692\nOther liabilities 7,062,100 30,000 7,092,100\nRetained earnings 8,984,821 708,862 9,693,683\nAs at December 31, 2022\nInvestments, net 41,017,758 738,862 41,756,620\nOther liabilities 6,894,569 30,000 6,924,569\nRetained earnings 6,819,244 708,862 7,528,106\nThe impact of these unrecorded equity investments on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was\nnot considered material, and therefore amounts for the comparative period have not been restated. Further, restated financial position as\nat January 1, 2023 has not been presented as the impact of non-presentation is not considered material.\n41. Board of Directors\u2019 approval\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board on Sha\u2019aban 3, 1446 (corresponding to February 2, 2025).\n82"

Basis of preparation\na) Statement of compliance\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared:\n\u2022 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and\nother standards and pronouncements issued by the Saudi Organisation for Chartered and Professional Accountants\n(\u2018SOCPA\u2019); and\n\u2022 in compliance with the provisions of Banking Control Law, the Regulations for Companies in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\nand By-laws of the Bank.\nb) Basis of measurement\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the measurement\nat fair value of derivatives, financial instruments held at fair value through statement of income (FVSI), at fair value through other\ncomprehensive income (FVOCI) and employee benefits which are stated at present value of their obligation. In addition, assets\nand liabilities that are hedged in a fair value hedging relationship are carried at fair value to the extent of the risks that are being\nhedged.\nc) Functional and presentation currency\nThese consolidated financial statements are expressed in Saudi Arabian Riyals (SAR), which is also the functional currency of SAB,\nand are rounded off to the nearest thousands, except where otherwise indicated.\nd) Presentation of consolidated financial statements\nThe Group presents its consolidated statement of financial position in order of liquidity. An analysis regarding recovery or\nsettlement within 12 months after the reporting date (current) and more than 12 months after the reporting date (non\u2013current)\nrelating to financial assets and financial labilities is presented in note 32(b).\ne) Basis of consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of SAB and its subsidiaries (as mentioned in note 1\ncollectively referred to as \u2018the Group\u2019). The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as that of\nSAB, using consistent accounting policies.\nSubsidiaries are entities which are directly or indirectly controlled by SAB. SAB controls an entity (the \u2018investee\u2019) over which it is\nexposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through\nits power over the investee. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to SAB and cease to be\nconsolidated from the date on which the control is transferred from SAB. Intra-group transactions and balances have been\neliminated upon consolidation.\nThe Group acts as a Fund Manager to a number of investment funds. Determining whether the Group controls such an investment\nfund usually focuses on the assessment of the aggregate economic interests of the Group in the Fund (comprising any carried interests\nand expected management fees) and the investors' rights to remove the Fund Manager. As a result, the Group has concluded that\nit acts as an agent for the investors in all cases, and therefore has not consolidated these funds.\n17"

It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the\nprocess of applying the Group\u2019s accounting policies. Such estimates, assumptions and judgements are continually evaluated and are\nbased on historical experience and other factors, including obtaining professional advice and expectations of future events that are\nbelieved to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nSignificant areas where management has used estimates, assumptions or exercised judgements are as follows:\nEstimates:\ni. Expected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets and loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts\nECL methodology\nThe measurement of impairment losses under IFRS 9 on the applicable categories of financial assets and loan commitments and\nfinancial guarantee contracts requires judgement, in particular, the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows and\ncollateral values when determining impairment losses and the assessment of a significant increase in credit risk.\nThese estimates are driven by a number of factors, changes in which can result in different levels of allowances. The Group\u2019s ECL\ncalculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the choice of variable inputs and\ntheir interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgements and estimates include:\n\u2022 the Group\u2019s internal credit grading model, which assigns Probability of Default (PDs) to the individual grades;\n\u2022 the Group\u2019s criteria for assessing if there has been a significant increase in credit risk, allowances for financial assets are\nmeasured on a Lifetime ECL basis and the qualitative assessment;\n\u2022 the segmentation of financial assets when the ECL is assessed on a collective basis;\n\u2022 development of ECL models, including the various formulae and the choice of inputs;\n\u2022 determination of associations between macroeconomic scenarios, economic inputs, such as unemployment levels and collateral\nvalues, and the effect on PDs, Exposure at Default (EADs) and Loss Given Default (LGDs); and\n\u2022 selection of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios and their probability weightings, to derive the economic inputs into the\nECL models.\nThe Group applies a low credit risk expedient on its margin financing portfolio as they are over collateralized by shares and cash.\nCollateral and other credit enhancements held\nThe Group\u2019s practice is to lend on the basis of customers\u2019 ability to meet their obligations out of cash flow resources rather than\nrely on the value of security offered. Depending on a customer\u2019s standing and the type of product, facilities may be provided\nwithout security. For other lending, a charge over collateral is obtained and considered in determining the credit decision and\npricing. In the event of default, the Group may utilise the collateral as a source of repayment. Depending on its form, collateral\ncan have a significant financial effect in mitigating our exposure to credit risk.\nAdditionally, risk may be managed by employing other types of collateral and credit risk enhancements such as second charges,\nother liens, and unsupported guarantees, but the valuation of such mitigants is less certain and their financial effect has not been\nquantified.\n18"

Fair value measurement\nThe Group measures financial instruments, such as investments and derivatives, at fair value at each reporting date. Also, fair\nvalues of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in note 34 to these consolidated financial statements.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to\nsell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\u2022 in the principal market for the asset or liability; or\n\u2022 in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured\nusing the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants\nact in their economic best interest.\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant\u2019s ability to generate economic benefits\nby using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest\nand best use. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are\navailable to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorised\nwithin the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement as a whole:\n\u2022 Level 1 \u2014 Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\u2022 Level 2 \u2014 Inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly\n(i.e. derived from prices). This category includes instruments valued using: quoted market prices in active markets for similar\ninstruments; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active or other\nvaluation techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data.\n\u2022 Level 3 \u2014 Inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments for which the valuation technique includes\ninputs that are not observable and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instrument\u2019s valuation. This\ncategory includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments for which significant\nunobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognised in these consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group\ndetermines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest\nlevel input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. For the purpose of fair\nvalue disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks\nof the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.\niii. Impairment of goodwill\nFor impairment testing, goodwill acquired through business combination is allocated to the cash generating units (CGUs) \u2013\nWealth & Personal Banking (WPB), Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB), Capital Markets and Treasury, which are also operating\nand reportable segments.\nThe impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated recoverable amount of the Group\u2019s CGUs that carry goodwill, as\ndetermined through a Value-In-Use (VIU) model, with the carrying amount of net assets of each CGU. Refer to note 9 for key\nassumption used for the VIU calculation.\n19"

Financial assets and financial liabilities\ni) Initial recognition, measurement and classification of financial assets\nThe Group on initial recognition classifies all of its financial assets based on the business model. Following are the three\nclassifications:\nAmortised Cost (AC):\nA financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as FVSI:\n\u2022 the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and\n\u2022 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and\ninterest.\nThe carrying amount of these assets is adjusted by any expected credit loss allowance recognised.\nFair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI):\nDebt instruments: a debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated\nas FVSI:\n\u2022 the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling\nfinancial assets; and\n\u2022 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal\nand interest on the principal amount outstanding.\nFVOCI debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising due to changes in fair value\nrecognised in OCI. Special commission income and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in consolidated statement\nof income.\nEquity Instruments: On initial recognition, for an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to\npresent subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.\nEquity instruments at FVOCI are not subject to an impairment assessment.\nFair value through statement of income (FVSI):\nAssets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through statement of income. A gain\nor loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through statement of income and is not part of a hedging\nrelationship is recognised in the consolidated statement of income in the year in which it arises.\nFinancial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Group changes its\nbusiness model for managing financial assets.\nBusiness model assessment\nThe Group assesses the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the\nway the business is managed, and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:\n\u2022 the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice;\n\u2022 how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group\u2019s management;\n23"

However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment\nof how the Group\u2019s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.\nFinancial assets that are held for trading and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVSI because\nthey are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.\nAssessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest\nFor the purposes of this assessment, \u2018principal\u2019 is the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. \u2018Interest\u2019 is the\nconsideration for the time value of money, the credit and other basic lending risks associated with the principal amount\noutstanding during a particular period and other basic lending costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), along with profit\nmargin. In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the\ncontractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could\nchange the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment,\nthe Group considers:\n\u2022 contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;\n\u2022 leverage features;\n\u2022 prepayment and extension terms;\n\u2022 terms that limit the Group\u2019s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse asset arrangements); and\n\u2022 features that modify consideration of the time value of money \u2013 e.g. periodical reset of interest rates.\nFinancial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Group changes its\nbusiness model for managing financial assets.\nii) Initial recognition, measurement and classification of financial liabilities\nAll financial liabilities are recognized at the time when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\nThe Group recognises its financial liabilities at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities as measured at\namortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) except for financial liabilities at fair value through statement of income.\nSuch liabilities, including derivatives that are liabilities, shall be subsequently measured at fair value.\niii) Derecognition\na. Financial assets\nA financial asset (or a part of a financial asset, or a part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised, when the\ncontractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expires.\nIn instances where the Group is assessed to have transferred a financial asset, the asset is derecognised if the Group has\ntransferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Where the Group has neither transferred nor retained\nsubstantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, the financial asset is derecognised only if the Group has not retained control\nof the financial asset. The Group recognises separately as assets or liabilities any rights and obligations created or retained in\nthe process.\nOn derecognition, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income is\nincluded in the consolidated statement of income for the year. Any cumulative gain/loss recognised in OCI in respect of equity\ninvestment securities designated as at FVOCI is not recognised in consolidated statement of income on derecognition of such\nsecurities.\n24"

Financial liabilities\nThe Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.\niv) Modifications of financial assets and financial liabilities\na. Financial assets\nIf the terms of a financial asset are modified, the Group evaluates whether the cash flows of the modified asset are substantially\ndifferent. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are\ndeemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised with the difference recognised as a de-\nrecognition gain or loss and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value.\nIn case the modification of asset does not result in de-recognition, the Group will recalculate the gross carrying amount of the\nasset by discounting the modified contractual cash-flows using EIR prior to the modification. Any difference between the\nrecalculated amount and the existing gross carrying amount is recognised in the consolidated statement of income for asset\nmodification.\nb. Financial liabilities\nThe Group derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified, and the cash flows of the modified liability are\nsubstantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

Financial instruments for which lifetime ECL are recognized but that are not credit-\nimpaired are referred to as \u2018Stage 2 financial instruments\u2019. Financial instruments allocated to stage 2 are those that have\nexperienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but are nor credit-impaired. Financial instruments for\nwhich the lifetime ECL are recognized and that are credit-impaired are referred to as \u2018Stage 3 financial instruments\u2019.\n25"

    "text": "Saudi Awwal Bank\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\nAll amounts in thousands of Saudi Riyals unless otherwise stated\nMeasurement of ECL\nECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:\n\u2022 financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls (e.g. the\ndifference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group\nexpects to receive);\n\u2022 financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the\npresent value of estimated future cash flows;\n\u2022 undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the\nGroup if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive; and\n\u2022 financial guarantee contracts: the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that the Group expects to\nrecover.\nThe Group\u2019s product offering includes a variety of corporate and retail overdraft and credit cards facilities, in which the Bank\nhas the right to cancel and/or reduce the facilities with one day\u2019s notice. The Group does not limit its exposure expectations of\ncustomer behaviour, the likelihood of default and its future risk mitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling\nthe facilities. Based on past experience and the Group\u2019s expectations, the period over which the Bank calculates ECL for these\nproducts, is five years for corporate, three years for credit cards and seven years for retail products. The ongoing assessment of\nwhether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred for revolving facilities is similar to other lending products. This is based\non shifts in the customer\u2019s internal credit grade, but greater emphasis is also given to qualitative factors such as changes in\nusage.\nThe interest rate used to discount the ECL for credit cards is based on the average effective interest rate that is expected to be\ncharged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. This estimation takes into account that many facilities are repaid in\nfull each month and are consequently not charged interest. The calculation of ECL, including the estimation of the expected\nperiod of exposure and discount rate is made, on an individual basis for corporate and on a collective basis for retail products.\nThe collective assessments are made separately for portfolios of facilities with similar credit risk characteristics.\nWhen discounting future cash flows, the following discount rates are used:\n\u2022 financial assets other than purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets and lease receivables: the original\neffective interest rate or an approximation thereof;\n\u2022 POCI assets: a credit-adjusted effective interest rate;\n\u2022 Undrawn loan commitments: the effective interest rate, or an approximation thereof, that will be applied to the financial\nasset resulting from the loan commitment; and\n\u2022 Financial Guarantee contracts issued: the rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and\nthe risks that are specific to the cash flows.\nRestructured financial assets\nIf the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to\nfinancial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the financial asset should be derecognised and\nECL are measured as follows:\n\u2022 if the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash flows arising from\nthe modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset;\n\u2022 if the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset\nis treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in\ncalculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition\nto the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.\n26"

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\u2022 significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;\n\u2022 a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;\n\u2022 the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;\n\u2022 it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or a financial reorganisation; or\n\u2022 the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\nA loan that has been renegotiated due to deterioration in the borrower\u2019s condition is usually considered to be credit- impaired\nunless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other\nindicators of impairment. In addition, a retail loan that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered impaired. In making an\nassessment of whether an investment in sovereign debt is credit-impaired, the Group considers the following factors:\n\u2022 the market\u2019s assessment of creditworthiness as reflected in the bond yields;\n\u2022 the rating agencies\u2019 assessments of creditworthiness;\n\u2022 the country\u2019s ability to access the capital markets for new debt issuance; and\n\u2022 the probability of debt being restructured, resulting in holders suffering losses through voluntary or mandatory debt\nforgiveness.\nPOCI financial assets are assets that are credit-impaired on initial recognition. For POCI assets, lifetime ECL are incorporated\ninto the calculation of the effective interest rate on initial recognition. Consequently, POCI assets do not carry impairment\nallowance on initial recognition. The amount recognized as a loss allowance subsequent to initial recognition is equal to the\nchanges in lifetime ECL since initial recognition of the asset.\nPresentation of provision for ECL in the consolidated statement of financial position\nProvision for ECL are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position as follows:\n\u2022 financial assets measured at amortised cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets;\n\u2022 loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts: generally, as a provision in other liabilities;\n\u2022 where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Group cannot identify the ECL on\nthe loan commitment component separately from those on the drawn component the Group presents a combined loss\nallowance for both components. The combined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the\ndrawn component. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is presented as a\nprovision; and\n\u2022 debt instruments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance is recognised in the statement of financial position because the\ncarrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance is disclosed and is recognised in the fair\nvalue reserve. Impairment losses are recognised in consolidated statement of income.\nWrite-off\nLoans and debt securities are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. However, financial\nassets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group\u2019s procedures for\nrecovery of amounts due. If the amount to be written off is greater than the accumulated loss allowance, the difference is first\ntreated as an addition to the allowance that is then applied against the gross carrying amount. Any subsequent recoveries are\ncredited to credit loss expense.\nCollateral valuation\nTo mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Group seeks to use collateral, where possible. The collateral comes in various\nforms, such as cash, securities, letters of credit / guarantees, real estate, receivables, inventories, other non- financial assets,\nand credit enhancements such as netting agreements. Collateral, unless repossessed, is not recorded on the Group\u2019s\n27"

However, the fair value of collateral affects the calculation of ECL. It is generally\nassessed, at a minimum, at inception and re-assessed on a periodic basis. However, some collateral, for example, cash or\nsecurities relating to margining requirements, is valued daily.\nTo the extent possible, the Group uses active market data for valuing financial assets, held as collateral. Other financial assets\nwhich do not have a readily determinable market value are valued using models. Non-financial collateral, such as real estate, is\nvalued based on data provided by third parties such as mortgage brokers, housing price indices, audited financial statements,\nand other independent sources.\nCollateral repossessed\nThe Group\u2019s policy is to determine whether a repossessed asset can be best used for its internal operations or should be sold.\nAssets determined to be useful for the internal operations are transferred to their relevant asset category at the lower of their fair\nvalue or the carrying value of the original secured asset. Assets for which selling is determined to be a better option are\ntransferred to assets held for sale at their fair value (if financial assets) and fair value less cost to sell for non- financial assets at\nthe repossession date in line with the Group\u2019s policy.\nIn its normal course of business, the Group does not physically repossess properties or other assets in its retail portfolio, but\nengages external agents to recover funds, generally at auction, to settle outstanding debt. Any surplus funds are returned to the\ncustomers/obligors. As a result of this practice, the residential properties under legal repossession processes are not recorded\non the consolidated statement of financial position.\nvi) Financial guarantees and loan commitments\nFinancial guarantees are initially recognised in the consolidated financial statements at fair value in other liabilities, being the value\nof the premium received.\nSubsequent to the initial recognition, the Group\u2019s liability under each guarantee is measured at higher of the unamortised amount\nand the provision for ECL.\nThe premium received is recognised in the consolidated statement of income in \u2018Fees and commission income\u2019 on a straight-line\nbasis over the life of the guarantee.\nLoan commitments are firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions. The Group has issued no\nloan commitments that are measured at FVSI. For loan commitments, the Group recognises provision for ECL.\nC. Trade date accounting\nAll regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on the trade date e.g. the date on which\nthe Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales are purchases and\nsales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention\nin the marketplace.\nD. Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\nDerivative financial instruments including foreign exchange contracts, special commission rate futures, forward rate\nagreements, currency and special commission rate swaps, currency, and special commission rate options (both written and\npurchased), are measured at fair value (premium received for written options). All derivatives are carried at their fair value as\nassets where the fair value is positive and as liabilities where the fair value is negative. Fair values are generally obtained by\nreference to quoted market prices, discounted cash flow models or pricing models, as appropriate.\n28"

Derivatives held for trading also include those derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.\nii) Embedded derivatives\nDerivatives embedded in other financial instruments are treated as separate derivatives and recorded at fair value if their economic\ncharacteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract, and the host contract is not itself held for trading or\ndesignated at fair value through statement of income. The embedded derivatives separated from the host are carried at fair value\nin the trading derivatives portfolio with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated statement of income.\niii)Hedge accounting\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in qualifying hedging relationships. For the purpose of hedge\naccounting, hedges are classified into two categories; (a) fair value hedges which hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value\nof a recognised asset or liability, and (b) cash flow hedges which hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either\nattributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction that\nwill affect the reported net gain or loss.\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, it is required that the hedge should be expected to be highly effective e.g., the changes\nin fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument should effectively offset corresponding changes in the hedged item and\nshould be reliably measurable. At the inception of the hedge, the risk management objective and strategy are documented\nincluding the identification of the hedging instrument, the related hedged item, the nature of risk being hedged, and how the\nGroup will assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed on an\nongoing basis.\nIn relation to fair value hedges, which meet the criteria for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging\ninstruments to fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of income. The related portion of the hedged\nitem is recognised in the consolidated statement of income.\nWhere the fair value hedge of a special commission bearing financial instrument ceases to meet the criteria for hedge accounting,\nthe adjustment in the carrying value is amortised to the consolidated statement of income over the remaining life of the\ninstrument. If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the\nconsolidated statement of income.\nIn relation to cash flow hedges, which meet the criteria for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging\ninstrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nThe ineffective portion, if any, is recognised in the consolidated statement of income.\nFor cash flow hedges affecting future transactions, the gains or losses recognised in other reserves are transferred to the\nconsolidated statement of income in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects the consolidated statement of\nincome.\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies\nfor hedge accounting. On discontinuation of hedge accounting on cash flow hedges any cumulative gain or loss that was\nrecognised in other reserves, is retained in Shareholders\u2019 equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. Where the hedged\nforecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other reserves is transferred\nto the consolidated statement of income for the year.\n29"

Revenue / expenses recognition\ni. Special commission income and expense\nSpecial commission income and expense for all commission-bearing financial instruments is recognised in the consolidated\nstatement of income on an effective yield basis.\nThe effective commission rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments and receipts through the\nexpected life of the financial asset or liability (or, where appropriate, a shorter period) to the carrying amount of the financial\nasset or liability. When calculating the effective commission rate, the Group estimates future cash flows considering all\ncontractual terms of the financial instrument but not future credit losses.\nThe carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability is adjusted if the Group revises its estimates of payments or\nreceipts. The adjusted carrying amount is calculated based on the original effective commission rate and the change in carrying\namount is recorded as special commission income or expense. If the recorded value of a financial asset or a group of similar\nfinancial assets has been reduced due to an impairment loss, special commission income continues to be recognised using the\noriginal effective commission rate applied to the new carrying amount.\nThe calculation of the effective yield takes into account all contractual terms of the financial instruments (prepayment, options\netc.) and includes all fees paid or received related transaction costs, and discounts or premiums that are an integral part of the\neffective commission rate. Transaction costs are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, issue or\ndisposal of financial asset or liability.\nWhen the Group enters into special commission rate swap to change special commission from fixed to floating (or vice versa) the\namount of special commission income or expense is adjusted by the net special commission on the swap.\nSpecial commission income on Shariah approved products received but not earned is netted off against the related assets.\nii. Exchange income / loss\nExchange income/loss is recognised when earned / incurred.\niii. Dividend income\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive income is established.\niv. Fees and commission income and expenses\nFee and commission income and expense that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset or financial liability\nare included in the effective interest rate. Other fee and commission income \u2013 including account servicing fees, investment\nmanagement fees, sales commission, placement fees and syndication fees \u2013 is recognised as the related services are performed.\nLoan commitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down are deferred and, together with the related direct cost are\nrecognised as an adjustment to the effective yield on the loan.\nWhen a loan commitment is not expected to result in the drawdown of a loan, loan commitment fees are recognised on a straight-\nline basis over the commitment period.\nAsset management fee is recognised based on a fixed percentage of net assets under management (\u2018asset-based\u2019), or a\npercentage of returns from net assets (\u2018returns-based\u2019) subject to applicable terms and conditions and service contracts with\ncustomers and funds. The Group attributes the revenue from management fees to the services provided during the year, because\nthe fee relates specifically to the Group\u2019s efforts to transfer the services for that period. The asset management fee is not subject\nto any claw backs.\n30"

The performance obligation of the Group is satisfied when the Group\ncarries out the transaction on behalf of the customers, which triggers immediate recognition of the revenue, as the Group will\nhave no further commitments.\nOther fees and commission expense relate mainly to transaction and service fees, which are expensed as the service is received.\nAny fee income received but not earned is classified under other liabilities.\nv. Day one profit\nWhere the transaction price differs from the fair value of other observable current market transactions in the same instrument\nor based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from active markets, the Group immediately recognises\nthe difference between the transaction price and fair value (a \u2018Day 1\u2019 profit) in the consolidated statement of income in \u2018Gain/(loss)\non FVSI financial instruments\u2019. In cases where use is made of data which is not observable, the amount deferred should be\nrecognized when there is a change in factors that market participants would take into account when pricing the asset or liability.\nIn some cases, the Group does not recognize a gain or loss on initial recognition of a financial asset or financial liability because\nthe fair value is neither evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability (i.e., a Level 1 input), nor\nbased on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets.\nvi. Customer Loyalty Program\nThe Group offers a customer loyalty program (reward points / air miles herein referred to as \u2018reward points\u2019), which allows card\nmembers to earn points that can be redeemed for certain Partner outlets. The Group allocates a portion of the transaction price\n(interchange fee) to the reward points awarded to card members, based on the relative stand-alone selling price. The amount\nof revenue allocated to reward points is deferred and released to the consolidated statement of income when reward points are\nredeemed under fee commission income. The related expenses for the customers\u2019 loyalty program are recognized under fee\ncommission expense. The cumulative amount of contract liability related unredeemed reward points is adjusted over time based\non actual experience and current trends with respect to redemption.\nF. Investment in equity-accounted investees\nThe Group\u2019s interests in equity-accounted investees comprise interests in associates.\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and\noperating policies. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net\nassets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.\nInterests in an associate is accounted for using the equity method. It is initially recognised at cost, which includes transaction\ncosts. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group\u2019s share of the profit or loss and\nOther Comprehensive Income (\u2018OCI\u2019) of equity-accounted investees, until the date on which significant influence ceases.\nThe consolidated statement of income reflects the Group\u2019s share of earnings of the associate.\nThe reporting dates of the associates is identical to the Group and their accounting policies conform to those used by the Group\nfor liker transactions and events in similar circumstances. Unrealised profits and losses resulting from transactions between the\nGroup and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group\u2019s interest in the associate.\n31"

These are included in the\nconsolidated statement of income.\nThe assets\u2019 residual values and useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate\nthat the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Any carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount\nif the asset\u2019s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.\nH. Intangible assets\ni. Goodwill\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination represents the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group\u2019s\ninterest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, including intangibles, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.\nWhen the excess is negative (bargain purchase), it is recognised immediately in the Group\u2019s consolidated statement of income.\nMeasurement\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost (being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount\nrecognised for non-controlling interests and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed). If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-\nassesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures\nused to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair\nvalue of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit.\nAfter initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Any goodwill arising from initial\nconsolidation is tested for impairment at least once a year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the need\nfor impairment, they are written down if required.\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to\neach of the Group\u2019s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of\nwhether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.\nThe cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an\nindication that the cash-generating unit may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable\namount of each cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable\namount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated\nstatement of income. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.\n32"

Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative fair values of the\noperations disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.\nii. Capitalised software\nSoftware acquired by the Group is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.\nSubsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the\nspecific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.\nAmortisation is recognised in the Group\u2019s consolidated statement of income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life\nof the software, from the date that it is available for use.\niii. Other intangibles\nAcquired other intangibles are recognised at their cost upon initial recognition. The specific criteria which need to be satisfied\nfor an intangible asset to be recognised separately from goodwill in an acquisition is that the intangible asset must be clearly\nidentifiable, in that it either:\n\u2022 be separable, that is, be capable of being separated or divided from the entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or\nexchanged, either individually or together with a related contract, asset, or liability; or\n\u2022 arise from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the entity\nor from other rights and obligations.\nOther intangibles are amortised using the straight-line method over the useful life of the asset, which is estimated to be 10 years\nfor Purchased Credit Cards Relationships (\u2018PCCR\u2019), 14 years for Core Deposit Intangible (\u2018CDI\u2019), 5 years for brand and 11-12 years\nfor Capital Markets (\u2018CM\u2019), Customer Relationships. If an indication of impairment arises, the recoverable amount is estimated,\nand an impairment loss is recognised if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount.\nThe banking license has an indefinite life and is tested for impairment annually. For impairment testing purposes, the banking\nlicense is allocated to the relevant cash generating unit.\nI. Leases\nRight of use asset (RoU) / Lease liabilities\nOn initial recognition, at inception of the contract, the Group shall assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract\nis, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange\nfor consideration. Control is identified if most of the benefits are flowing to the Group and the Group can direct the usage of such\nassets. The Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and\nnon-lease components as a single lease component.\nRight of use assets\nThe Group applies a cost model, and measures right of use asset at cost;\n\u2022 less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, if any; and\n\u2022 adjusted for any re-measurement of the lease liability for lease modifications.\n33"

Generally, the\nGroup uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. After the commencement date, the Group measures the lease\nliability by:\n\u2022 increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability;\n\u2022 reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and\n\u2022 re-measuring the carrying amount to reflect any re-assessment or lease modification.\nThe lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is re-measured when there is a change\nin future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group\u2019s estimate of the amount\nexpected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a\npurchase, extension, or termination option. When the lease liability is re-measured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is\nmade to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in consolidated statement of income if the carrying amount\nof the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\nJ. End of service benefits\nThe provision for end of service benefits is made based on actuarial valuation in accordance with Saudi Arabian Labour Laws.\nNet obligation, with respect to end of service benefits, to the Group is reviewed by using a projected unit credit method. Actuarial\ngains and losses (Re-measurements) are recognized in full in the period in which they occur in other comprehensive income.\nRe-measurements are not reclassified to consolidated statement of income in subsequent periods.\nInterest expense is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability. The Group recognizes the following\nchanges in the net defined benefit obligation under \u2018salaries and employee related expenses\u2019 in the consolidated statement of\nincome:\n\u2022 service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine\nsettlements, and\n\u2022 net interest expense or income\nThe assumptions used to calculate the scheme obligations include assumptions such as expected future salaries growth,\nexpected employee resignation rates, and discount rate to discount the future cash flows.\nK. Share based payments\nUnder the terms of the Equity Based Long Term Bonus Plan, eligible employees of the Group are offers shares at a predetermined\nprice for a fixed period of time. At the vesting dates determined under the terms of the plan, the Group delivers the underlying\nallotted shares to the employees, subject to the satisfactory completion of the vesting conditions. The cost of the plans is\nrecognised over the period in which the service condition is fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become\nfully entitled to the shares (\u2018the vesting date\u2019).\nThe cumulative expense recognised for these plans at each reporting date until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the\nvesting period has expired and the Group\u2019s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.\nL. Government grant\nThe Group recognizes a government grant related to income, if there is a reasonable assurance that it will be received, and the\nGroup will comply with the conditions associated with the grant.\n34"

The government grant is recognised in the consolidated statement of income on a systematic basis over the periods\nin which the Group recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grant is intended to compensate. The grant income\nis only recognised when the ultimate beneficiary is the Group. Where the customer is the ultimate beneficiary, the Group only\nrecords the respective receivable and payable amounts.\nM. Zakat and Income tax\nZakat\nThe Group is subject to Zakat in accordance with the regulations of the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority (\u2018ZATCA\u2019). Zakat expense\nis charged to the consolidated statement of income. Zakat is not accounted for as income tax and as such no deferred tax is\ncalculated relating to Zakat.\nIncome tax\nThe income tax expense for the year is the tax payable on the current year\u2019s taxable income, based on the applicable income tax\nrate in Saudi Arabia, adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused\ntax losses.\nThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the\nreporting period in the countries where the bank and its subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income.\nManagement periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations\nare subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions, where appropriate, on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax\nauthorities. Adjustments arising from the final income tax assessments are recorded in the period in which such assessments\nare made.\nDeferred tax\nDeferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of\nassets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax\nprovided is based on the expected manner of realization or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities using the\ntax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. A deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is\nprobable that future taxable profits will be available, and the credits can be utilized.\nValue Added tax (VAT)\nThe Group collects VAT from its customers for qualifying services provided and makes VAT payments to its vendors for qualifying\npayments. On a monthly basis, net VAT remittances are made to the ZATCA representing VAT collected from its customers, net\nof any recoverable VAT on payments. Unrecoverable VAT is borne by the Group and is either expensed or in the case of property,\nequipment, and intangibles payments, is capitalized and either depreciated or amortized as part of the capital cost.\nN. Islamic banking products\nIn addition to conventional banking, the Group also provides Shari\u2019ah-compliant products, which are approved and supervised\nby an independent Shari\u2019ah Committee established by SAB. All Shari\u2019ah approved banking products are accounted for using\nIFRS and are in conformity with the accounting policies described in these consolidated financial statements.\n35"

At each reporting period, an\nassessment is made for indicators of impairment. If indicators exist, an impairment test is required. The impairment test\ncompares the estimated recoverable amount of the Group\u2019s CGUs that carry goodwill, as determined through a Value-In- Use\n(VIU) model, with the carrying amount of net assets of each CGU. The goodwill has been allocated to the following cash-\ngenerating units:\n\u2022 Wealth & personal banking\n\u2022 Corporate and institutional banking\n\u2022 Treasury\nKey assumptions used to value-in-use calculation\nThe recoverable amount of the cash-generating units has been determined based on a value in use calculation. The VIU model\nuses projected cash flows in perpetuity through a five-year forward period of projections, and thereafter applying a (long-term)\nterminal growth rate.\nThe calculation of VIU in the CGUs is mainly driven by the following assumptions:\n\u2022 Economic outlook, notably the projected nominal Gross Domestic Product (\u2018GDP\u2019);\n\u2022 Discount rates;\n\u2022 Long term assets growth rates;\n\u2022 Benchmark interest rates and net special commission income margins;\n\u2022 Future cost of risk from expected credit losses;\n\u2022 Local inflation rates; and\n\u2022 Target Capital ratio and profit retention.\nThe following key assumptions were used in the calculation of the VIU:\n\u2022 Discount rate of 10.69% (2023: 10.02%), which is derived using a weighted average cost of capital \u201cWACC\u201d that calculates\nthe cost of capital by applying weightage of equity and debt to their respective cost of financing.\n\u2022 Long term asset growth rate of 4.0% (2023: 4.0%), applied to projected periods beyond 2029.\n\u2022 Long-term profit growth rate of 5.57% (2023: 4.89%), derived from economic intelligent units\u2019 forecasts of nominal GDP\nfor KSA adjusted for expected changes in benchmark interest rates and sector growth rates over time, applied to projected\nperiods beyond 2029.\nKey assumptions used in impairment testing for goodwill\nThe calculation of value in use in the cash-generating units is sensitive to the following assumptions:\n\u2022 interest margins;\n\u2022 discount rates;\n\u2022 projected growth rates used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the projection period; and\n\u2022 current Kingdom of Saudi Arabia nominal GDP.\n56"

These are changed over the budget period\nfor anticipated market conditions.\nDiscount rates\nDiscount rates reflect management\u2019s estimate of weighted average cost of capital required in each business.

Derivatives\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Group uses the following derivative financial instruments for both trading and hedging\npurposes:\na) Forwards and futures\nForwards and futures are contractual agreements to either buy or sell a specified currency, commodity or financial instrument\nat a specified price and date in the future. Forwards are customised contracts transacted in the over-the-counter market. Foreign\ncurrency and special commission rate futures are transacted in standardised amounts on regulated exchanges, and changes in\nfutures contract values are settled daily.\nb) Options\nOptions are contractual agreements under which the seller (writer) grants the purchaser (holder) the right, but not the obligation,\nto either buy or sell at a fixed future date or at any time during a specified period, a specified amount of a currency, commodity,\nor financial instrument at a predetermined price.\nc) Swaps\nSwaps are commitments to exchange one set of cash flows for another. For special commission rate swaps, counterparties\ngenerally exchange fixed and floating rate special commission payments in a single currency without exchanging principal. For\ncurrency swaps, fixed special commission payments and principal are exchanged in different currencies. For cross currency\nspecial commission rate swaps, principal, fixed and floating special commission payments are exchanged in different currencies.\nRisk-related adjustments\nBid-offer:\nValuation models generates mid-market values. The bid-offer adjustment reflects the extent to which bid-offer cost would be\nincurred if substantially all residual net portfolio market risks were closed using available hedging instruments or by disposing\nof or unwinding the position.\nCredit valuation adjustment (CVA):\nThe credit valuation adjustment is an adjustment to the valuation of Over the Counter (OTC) derivative contracts to reflect within\nfair value the possibility that the counterparty may default and that SAB may not receive the full market value of the transactions.\n58"

SAB calculates the CVA by\napplying the probability of default (\u2018PD\u2019) of the counterparty conditional on the non-default of SAB to the expected positive\nexposure to the counterparty and multiplying the result by the loss expected in the event of default.\nConversely, SAB calculates the DVA by applying the PD of SAB, conditional on the non-default of the counterparty, to the expected\npositive exposure of the counterparty to SAB and multiplying by the loss expected in the event of default. Both calculations are\nperformed over the life of the potential exposure.\nDerivatives held for trading purposes\nMost of the Group\u2019s derivative trading activities relate to sales, positioning, and arbitrage. Sales activities involve offering\nproducts to customers in order, inter alia, to enable them to transfer, modify or reduce current and future risks. Positioning\ninvolves managing market risk positions with the expectation of profiting from favourable movements in prices, rates, or\nindices. Arbitrage involves identifying, with the expectation of profiting from price differentials between markets or products.\nDerivatives held for hedging purposes\nThe Group has adopted a comprehensive system for the measurement and management of risk (see note 30 - financial risk\nmanagement, note 31 - market risk and note 32 - liquidity risk). Part of the risk management process involves managing the\nGroup\u2019s exposure to fluctuations in various asset classes including, but not limited to foreign exchange, interest rates and\ncommodities within acceptable levels, as determined by the Board Risk Committee within the guidelines issued by SAMA. The\nBoard Risk Committee establishes the levels of risk appetite for the Bank. Positions are monitored on a daily basis and hedging\nstrategies are used to ensure that positions are maintained within the established limits. Asset and liability special commission\nrate gaps are reviewed on a periodic basis and hedging strategies are used to maintain special commission rate gaps within the\nestablished limits.\nAs part of its asset and liability management process, the Group uses derivatives for hedging purposes in order to adjust its\nexposure to currency and special commission rate risks. This is generally achieved by hedging specific transactions as well as by\nstrategic hedging against overall statement of financial position exposures. Strategic hedging other than portfolio hedging does\nnot qualify for hedge accounting and the related derivatives are accounted for as held for trading. The Group uses forward foreign\nexchange contracts and currency swaps to hedge against specifically identified currency risks. In addition, the Group uses\nspecial commission rate swaps to hedge against the special commission rate risk arising from specifically identified fixed special\ncommission rate exposures. The Group also uses special commission rate swaps to hedge against the cash flow risk arising on\ncertain floating rate exposures. In all such cases, the hedging relationship and objective, including the details of the hedged\nitems and hedging instruments, are formally documented and the transactions are accounted for as fair value or cash flow\nhedges.\n59"

For prospective effectiveness,\nthe hedging instrument must be expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to\nthe hedged risk during the period for which the hedge is designated, with the effectiveness range being defined as 80% to 125%.\nHedge ineffectiveness is recognised in the consolidated statement of income \u2018Income from FVSI financial instruments\u2019. For Cash\nflow hedges \u2018the critical terms matches\u2019 methodology is used at time of designation of hedge.\nSource of ineffectiveness for fair value hedges and cash flow hedges\nPossible source of ineffectiveness for fair value hedges and cash flow hedges are as follows:\n\u2022 difference between the expected and actual volume of prepayments, as the Group hedges to the expected repayment\ndate taking into account expected prepayments based on past experience;\n\u2022 difference in the discounting between the hedge item and hedge instrument, as cash collateralized interest rate swaps are\ndiscounted using Overnight Indexed Swaps discount curves, which are not applied to the fixed rate mortgages;\n\u2022 hedging derivative with a non-zero fair value at the date of initial designation as a hedging instrument;\n\u2022 counter party credit risk which impacts the fair value of uncollateralized interest rate swaps but not the hedge items.\nCash flow hedges\nThe Group is exposed to variability in future special commission cash flows on non-trading assets which bear special commission\nincome at a variable rate. The Group uses commission rate/cross - currency swaps as cash flow hedges to hedge these special\ncommission rate risks.\nBelow is the schedule indicating as at 31 December, the periods when the hedged cash flows are expected to occur and when\nthey are expected to affect statement of income:\n2024 Within 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years Over 5 years\nCash inflows (assets) 219,750 203,689 30,416 -\nNet cash inflow 219,750 203,689 30,416 -\n2023\nCash inflows (assets) 180,557 451,469 52,111 13,177\nNet cash inflow 180,557 451,469 52,111 13,177\nThe schedule reflects special commission income cash flows expected to arise on the hedged items in cash flow hedges based\non the repricing profile of the hedged assets and liabilities.

Commitments and contingencies\na) Legal proceedings\nThere are no material outstanding legal proceedings against the Group.\nb) Capital commitments\nAs at 31 December 2024, the Group has capital commitments of SAR 1,340 million (2023: SAR 1,316 million) in respect of land,\nbuildings, equipment and software purchases.\nc) Credit related commitments and contingencies\nCredit related commitments and contingencies mainly comprise guarantees letters of credit acceptances and commitments to\nextend credit. Guarantees and standby letters of credit, which represent irrevocable assurances that the Group will make\npayments in the event that a customer cannot meet its obligations to third parties, carry the same credit risk as loans and\nadvances. Documentary letters of credit, which are written undertakings by the Group on behalf of a customer authorising a\nthird party to draw drafts on the Group up to a stipulated amount under specific terms and conditions, are generally collateralized\nby the underlying shipments of goods to which they relate and therefore have significantly less risk.\nAcceptances comprise undertakings by the Group to pay bills of exchange drawn on customers. The cash requirement under\nthese instruments is considerably less than the amount of the related commitment because the Group generally expects the\ncustomers to fulfill their primary obligation.\nCommitments to extend credit represent the unutilised portion of authorisations to extend credit, principally in the form of loans\nand advances, guarantees and letters of credit. With respect to credit risk on commitments to extend credit, the Group is\npotentially exposed to a loss in an amount equal to the total unutilised commitments. However, the likely amount of loss, which\ncannot readily be quantified, is expected to be considerably less than the total unutilised commitment as most commitments to\nextend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards.\nThe total outstanding commitments to extend credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, as many of the\ncommitments could expire or be terminated without being funded.

Financial risk management\ni) Credit risk\nThe Group follows SAMA Rules on Credit Risk Management whereby the Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for the\neffective management of risk and approves the risk appetite. The Board has constituted a Board Risk Committee (BRC) for the\nongoing monitoring, assessment and management of the risk environment and the effectiveness of the risk management\nframework. Day-to-day responsibility for risk management is delegated to senior managers with individual accountability for\ndecision making.\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract. Credit risk arises\nprincipally from direct lending, trade finance and leasing activities, but also from other products such as guarantees and\nderivatives.\nThe Group continues to assess the impact of economic developments on specific customers, customer segments or portfolios.\nAs credit conditions change, the Group takes mitigating actions, including the revision of risk appetites or limits and tenors, as\nappropriate. In addition, the Group continues to manage credit risk by monitoring credit exposures, limiting transactions with\nspecific counterparties, and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. Credit approval authorities are\ndelegated by the Board to the Managing Director together with the authority to sub-delegate them. The Credit Risk function is\nresponsible for the key policies and processes for managing credit risk, which include formulating credit policies and risk rating\nframeworks, guiding the Group\u2019s appetite for credit risk exposures, undertaking independent reviews and objective assessment\nof credit risk, and monitoring performance and management of portfolios.\nConcentrations of credit risk arise when a number of counterparties have comparable economic characteristics, or such\ncounterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or operate in the same geographical areas or industry sectors so that\ntheir collective ability to meet contractual obligations is uniformly affected by changes in economic, political, or other\nconditions. The Group uses a number of controls and measures to minimize undue concentration of exposure in the portfolios.\nThese include portfolio and counterparty limits, approval and review controls, and stress testing.\na) Provision for expected credit losses, net\nThe following table shows the provision for expected credit losses for due from banks and other financial institutions, investments,\nloans and advances and off balance sheet exposures:\nNotes 2024 2023\nNet provision for expected credit losses:\nDue from banks and other financial institutions 4 (d) (69) 1,128\nInvestments 5 (d) 1,133 (4,712)\nLoans and advances 6 (c) (575,962) (931,618)\nLoan commitments and financial guarantee contracts 20 (c) (111,945) (72,240)\nWrite-offs net, recoveries of debts previously written-off* 120,780 445,000\nNet charge for the year (566,063) (562,442)\n* Write-offs net, recoveries of debts previously written-off include purchase price allocation release from POCI\naccounts of SAR 248 million (2023: SAR 486 million).\n87"

At initial recognition, an allowance (or provision in the case of some loan\ncommitments and financial guarantees) is required for ECL resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12\nmonths, or less, where the remaining life is less than 12 months (12-month ECL). In the event of a significant increase in credit\nrisk, an allowance (or provision) is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial\ninstrument (lifetime ECL).\nWrite-off\nFinancial assets (and the related impairment allowances) are normally written off, either partially or in full, when there is no\nrealistic prospect of recovery. Where loans are secured, this is generally after receipt of any proceeds from the realization of\nsecurity. In circumstances where the net realizable value of any collateral has been determined and there is no reasonable\nexpectation of further recovery, write-off may be earlier.\nForbearance\nLoans are identified as forborne and classified as either performing or non-performing when the Group modifies the\ncontractual terms due to financial difficulty of the borrower. Non-performing forborne loans are stage 3 and classified as non-\nperforming until they met the cure criteria. Performing forborne loans are initially stage 2 and remain classified as forborne\nuntil they meet applicable cure criteria. At this point, the loan is either stage 1 or stage 2 as determined by comparing the\nrisk of a default occurring at the reporting date (based on the modified contractual terms) and the risk of a default occurring\nat initial recognition (based on the original, unmodified contractual terms).\nDefinition of (default)\nThe Group considers a financial asset to be in default when:\n\u2022 A quantitative objective based indicator where the obligor\u2019s contractual repayments are past due in excess-over-limits or\nhas overdrawn advised agreed limits for more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the Group.\n\u2022 A qualitative criterion by which the Group considers that the obligor is \u2018unlikely-to-pay\u2019 its obligations to the Group in full\nwithout recourse by the Group to action such as realizing securities (if any).\n90"

    "text": "Saudi Awwal Bank\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\nAll amounts in thousands of Saudi Riyals unless otherwise stated\nSome of the primary indicators for qualitative criteria to objectively define \u2018Unlikeliness to Pay\u2019 (UTP) events\u2019 could be the following:\n\u2022 Distressed debt restructuring resulting in diminished financial obligation\n\u2022 Significant and/or persistent deteriorations in financial performance, financial ratios, covenants waivers/easing, cash\nflow and liquidity concerns and future outlook of the obligor\n\u2022 Imminent probability of facility foreclosure and/or repossession of collaterals / securities due to insolvency or other\nfinancial difficulties indicating Bank\u2019s inability to recover the exposure.\nInputs into the assessment of whether a financial instrument is in default and their significance may vary over time to reflect\nchanges in circumstances.\nThe definition of default largely aligns with that applied by the Group for regulatory capital purposes.\nLoan modifications other than forborne loans\nLoan modifications that are not identified as forborne are considered to be commercial restructurings. Where a commercial\nrestructuring results in a modification (whether legalized through an amendment to the existing terms or the issuance of a new\nloan contract) such that the Group rights to the cash flows under the original contract have expired, the old loan is derecognized\nand the new loan is recognized at fair value. The rights to cash flows are generally considered to have expired if the commercial\nrestructure is at market rates and no payment-related concession has been provided.\nMeasurement of ECL\nDuring 2024 the Bank has completed the redevelopment of its IFRS 9 wholesale and retail models in accordance with SAMA's\ntriennial model redevelopment requirement and IFRS 9 compliance standards. The primary objective of this initiative was to\nenhance the models' accuracy and alignment with regulatory requirements. A change introduced was the segmentation of\nthe small and medium enterprises (SME) portfolio as a standalone category, which was previously incorporated within the\nCorporate model. The financial impact of this redevelopment is detailed in the financial impact section.\nThe assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL are unbiased and probability-weighted, and incorporate all available\ninformation which is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable\nand supportable forecasts of future events and economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL\nshould take into account the time value of money.\nIn general, the Group calculates ECL using three main components: a probability of default (PD), a loss given default (LGD) and\nthe exposure at default (EAD). The 12-month ECL is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD, LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is\ncalculated using the lifetime PD instead. The 12-month and lifetime PDs represent the probability of default occurring over the\nnext 12 months and the remaining maturity of the instrument respectively.\nThe EAD represents the expected balance at default, taking into account the repayment of principal and interest from the\nbalance sheet date to the default event together with any expected drawdowns of committed facilities. The LGD represents\nexpected losses on the EAD given the event of default, taking into account, among other attributes the time value of money.\nThe ECL for wholesale stage 3 is determined on an individual basis using a discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology. The\nexpected future cash flows are based on the credit risk officer\u2019s estimates as of the reporting date, reflecting reasonable and\nsupportable assumptions and projections of future recoveries and expected future receipts of interest.\nThe cash flows are discounted at a reasonable approximation of the effective interest rate by using the contractual interest rate.\n91"

Market risk\nMarket Risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market\nvariables such as special commission rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices. The Group classifies exposures to\nmarket risk into either trading and non-trading or banking-book. Market Risk exposures in the trading book result from\ninstruments classified as held for trading as disclosed in these consolidated financial statements. Market Risk exposures in the\nnon-trading or banking-book arise on special commission rate risk and equity price risk as disclosed in part b) of this disclosure.\nThe market risk for both the trading book and the non-trading book is managed and monitored using a combination of VAR,\nstress testing and sensitivity analysis.\na) Market risk-trading book\nThe Board has set limits for the acceptable level of risks in managing the trading book. The Group applies a VAR methodology to\nassess the market risk positions held and to estimate the potential economic loss based upon a number of parameters and\nassumptions for change in market conditions.\nA VAR methodology estimates the potential negative change in market value of a portfolio at a given confidence level and over\na specified time horizon. The Group uses simulation models to assess the possible changes in the market value of the trading\nbook based on historical data.\nVAR models are usually designed to measure the market risk in a normal market environment and therefore the use of VAR has\nlimitations because it is based on historical correlations and volatilities in market prices and assumes that the future movements\nwill follow a statistical distribution.\nThe VAR that the Group measures is an estimate, using a confidence level of 99% of the potential loss that is not expected to be\nexceeded if the current market positions were to be held unchanged for 1 day. The use of 99% confidence level depicts that\nwithin a one-day horizon, losses exceeding VAR figure should occur, on average, not more than once every hundred days. The\nVAR represents the risk of portfolios at the close of a business day, and it does not account for any losses that may occur beyond\nthe defined confidence interval. The actual trading results, however, may differ from the VAR calculations and, in particular, the\ncalculation does not provide a meaningful indication of profits and losses in stressed market conditions.\nIn addition to VAR, the Group also carries out stress testing of its portfolio to simulate conditions outside normal confidence\nintervals. The potential losses occurring under stress test conditions are reported regularly to the Group\u2019s Risk Management\nCommittee (RMC) for their review.\nThe Group\u2019s VAR related information is as follows\nSpecial\nForeign Overall\n2024 commission\nexchange risk\nrate\nVAR as at 31 December 2024 1,767 8,302 8,808\nAverage VAR for 2024 2,328 10,779 11,078\nMinimum VAR for 2024 1,127 6,815 7,955\nMaximum VAR for 2024 3,719 19,208 20,102\n94"

The\nGroup does not maintain material non-trading open currency positions. Foreign currency exposures that arise in the non-\ntrading book are transferred to the trading book and are managed as part of the trading portfolio. The foreign exchange risk\nVAR disclosed in note 31 (a) reflects the Group\u2019s total exposure to currency risk.\nThe Group is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Board of Directors sets limits on the level of\nexposure by currency, and in total for both overnight and intraday positions, which are monitored daily. At the end of the year,\nthe Group had the following significant net exposures denominated in foreign currencies:\n2024 2023\nLong / (short) Long / (short)\nUS Dollar (266,533) 529,272\nEuro (1,423) (2,200)\nSterling Pounds 3,298 (31,787)\nOther 42,802 (33,645)\nThe table below shows the currencies to which the Bank has a significant exposure on its non-trading monetary assets and\nliabilities and forecasted cash flows. The analysis calculates the effect of reasonable possible movement of the currency rate\nagainst SAR, with all other variables held constant, on the statement of income and equity. A positive effect shows a potential\nincrease in the statement of income or equity, whereas a negative effect shows a potential net reduction in the statement of\nincome or equity.\n31 December 2024\nChanges in\nEffect on Effect on\nCurrency Exposures currency rate in\nnet income Equity\n%\nUS Dollar +5 (838) 736\n-5 838 (736)\nEuro +3 (40) -\n-3 40 -\nPound Sterling +3 (20) -\n-3 20 -\n99"

Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due under normal and stress\ncircumstances. Liquidity risk can be caused by market disruptions or credit downgrades, which may cause certain sources of\nfunding to be less readily available. To mitigate this risk, management has diversified funding sources in addition to its core\ndeposit base, manages assets with liquidity in mind, maintaining an appropriate balance of cash, cash equivalents and readily\nmarketable securities and monitors future cash flows and liquidity on a daily basis. The Group also has committed lines of credit\nthat it can access to meet liquidity needs.\nIn accordance with the Banking Control Law and the regulations issued by SAMA, the Group maintains a statutory deposit with\nSAMA of 7% of monthly average demand deposits and 4% of monthly average of savings and time deposits. In addition to the\nstatutory deposit, the Group also maintains liquid reserves of not less than 20% of the deposit liabilities, in the form of cash,\nSaudi Government Development Bonds or assets, which can be converted into cash within a period not exceeding 30 days.\nThe Group has the ability to raise additional funds through repo facilities available with SAMA against Saudi Government\nDevelopment securities.\nThe table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group\u2019s financial liabilities. The contractual maturities of liabilities have\nbeen determined on the basis of the remaining period at the reporting date to the contractual maturity date and does not take\naccount of effective maturities as indicated by the Group\u2019s deposit retention history. The amounts disclosed in the table are the\ncontractual undiscounted cash flows, whereas the Group manages the inherent liquidity risk based on expected undiscounted\ncash inflows. All derivatives used for hedging purposes are shown by maturity based on their contractual, undiscounted\nrepayment obligations. As the major portion of the derivatives trading book comprises of back to back transactions and\nconsequently the open derivatives trading exposures are small, the management believes that the inclusion of trading derivatives\nin the contractual maturity table is not relevant for an understanding of the timing of cash flows and hence these have been\nexcluded. Management monitors the maturity profile to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained. The weekly liquidity\nposition is monitored, and regular liquidity stress testing is conducted under a variety of scenarios covering both normal and\nmore severe market conditions. All liquidity policies and procedures are subject to review and approval by Asset and Liability\nCommittee (\u2018ALCO\u2019).\nA summary report, covering the Group and operating subsidiaries, including any exceptions and remedial action taken, is\nsubmitted monthly to ALCO.\n100"

    "text": "Saudi Awwal Bank\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nFor the year ended 31 December 2024\nAll amounts in thousands of Saudi Riyals unless otherwise stated\nThe Group, as part of its derivative management activities, has entered into a master agreement in accordance with the\nInternational Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA) directives. Under this agreement, the terms and conditions for derivative\nproducts purchased or sold by the SAB Group are unified. As part of the master agreement, a credit support annex (CSA) has\nalso been signed. The CSA allows the Group to receive improved pricing by way of exchange of mark to market amounts in\ncash as collateral whether in favor of the Group or the counter party.\nFor commission rate swaps entered into with European counterparties, the SAB Group and the European counterparty both\ncomply with the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). EMIR is a body of European legislation for the central\nclearing and regulation of OTC derivatives. The regulation includes requirements for reporting of derivatives contracts and\nimplementation of risk management standards and establishes common rules for central counterparties and trade repositories.\nAccordingly, all such standardized OTC derivatives contracts are traded on exchanges and cleared through a Central Counter\nParty (CCP) through netting arrangements and exchanges of cash to reduce counter party credit and liquidity risk.\nThe positive and negative fair values of derivatives including CSA and EMIR cash margins have been netted/offset when there\nis a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and when the Group intends to settle on a net basis, or to realize\nthe assets and settle the liability simultaneously.\n34. Fair value of financial instruments\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal\n(or the most advantageous) market between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions\nregardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique.

Availability of observable market prices and\nmodel inputs reduces the need for management judgment and estimation and also reduces the uncertainty associated with\ndetermining fair values. Availability of observable market prices and inputs varies depending on the products and markets and\nis prone to changes based on specific events and general conditions in the financial markets The difference between the\ntransaction price and the model value is commonly referred to as \u2018day one profit or loss\u2019. It is either amortised over the life of\nthe transaction or deferred until the instrument\u2019s fair value can be determined using market observable data or realized through\ndisposal. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of income without reversal\nof deferred day one profits and losses.\nValuation techniques include net present value and discounted cash flow models, and comparison with similar instruments for\nwhich market observable prices exist. Assumptions and inputs used in valuation techniques include risk-free and benchmark\ninterest rates, credit spreads and other premiums used in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices and foreign currency\nexchange rates.\nDerivatives classified as Level 2 comprise OTC special commission rate swaps, currency swaps, special commission rate\noptions, forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options and other derivative financial instruments. These derivatives are\nfair valued using the Group's proprietary valuation models that are based on discounted cash flow techniques. The data inputs\nto these models are based on observable market parameters relevant to the markets in which they are traded and are sourced\nfrom widely used market data service providers.\nFVOCI equity investments include investments in local listed shares carried at market price listed on local stock exchange.\nFVOCI investments classified as Level 2 include bonds for which market quotes are not available. These are fair valued using\nsimple discounted cash flow techniques that use observable market data inputs for yield curves and credit spreads.\nFVOCI investments classified as Level 3 represents private equity investments, the fair value of which is determined based on\nthe latest reported net assets value as at the reporting date. The movement in Level 3 financial instruments during the period\nrelates to fair value and capital repayment movements only.\n106"

Capital risk management\nThe Group monitors the adequacy of its capital using the methodology and ratios established by SAMA. These ratios measure\ncapital adequacy by comparing the Group\u2019s eligible capital with its assets, commitments and contingencies, and notional\namounts of derivatives at a weighted amount to reflect their relative risk.\nSAMA, through Circular Number 391000029731 dated 15 Rabi Al-Awwal 1439H (3 December 2017), provided guidance on the\ninterim approach and transitional arrangements for accounting allocations under IFRS 9. The directive required banks to\ntransition the initial impact on the capital adequacy ratio over five years. However, the latest SAMA guidance on Accounting\nand Regulatory Treatment of COVID-19 Extraordinary Support Measures allows banks to add back up to 100% of the transitional\nadjustment amount to Common Equity Tier 1 (\u2018CET1\u2019) for the full two-year period of 2020 and 2021, effective from the 31 March\n2021 financial statement reporting. Starting in 2022, the add-back amount will be phased out on a straight-line basis over three\nyears. As a result of these revised transitional arrangements, the Group's Tier 1 ratio improved by 23 basis points for the year\nended 31 December 2024.\nThe following table summarizes the Bank's Pillar-1 Risk Weighted Assets, Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital and capital adequacy ratios\n2024 2023\nRisk Weighted Assets (RWA)\nCredit Risk RWA 308,505,820 279,968,368\nOperational Risk RWA 12,233,759 10,458,162\nMarket Risk RWA 1,193,229 3,724,396\nTotal RWA 321,932,808 294,150,926\nCommon Equity Tier I Capital 49,660,716 48,053,574\nAdditional Tier I Capital (Note 19) 7,965,000 3,985,000\nTier I Capital 57,625,716 52,038,574\nTier II Capital 5,778,894 5,958,473\nTotal I and II Capital 63,404,610 57,997,047\nCapital Adequacy Ratio %\nTier I ratio 17.90% 17.69%\nTier I + Tier II ratio 19.69% 19.72%\nCET1 15.43% 16.34%\n37.

Government grant\nDuring the year of 2023, the Real Estate Development Fund (\u2018REDF\u2019) launched a new programme (\u2018the programme\u2019) to support\nresidential mortgage finance to certain eligible customers at a subsidized profit rate and within a specified period. The Bank\nsigned an agreement with REDF to become a party to this programme on 11 November 2023.\nIn accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9, the programme has resulted in a fair value loss on origination of the subsidized\nmortgage facilities due to the below market profit rate which is offset by the compensation amount received from REDF. The\nBank\u2019s management has determined that the amount received qualifies as a government grant under IAS 20 and is recorded as\ndeferred income being amortized over the average life of the loans.\n40.

Comparative figures\nDuring the year, the Bank has re-evaluated the presentation of certain balances within due to banks and other financial institutions\nin the consolidated statement of financial position to determine if such balances were appropriately presented in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These balances were re-evaluated by management as new information was received to substantiate the\nfact that these balances were in fact deposits from customers. Where necessary, changes in presentation of prior years were\nmade in accordance with IAS 8 \"Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors\".\nAs a result of the re-evaluation, the liability balances amounting to SAR 12.5 billion as of 31 December 2023 (1 January 2023:\nSAR 8.1 billion) were reclassified from due to banks and other financial institutions to customers\u2019 deposits. The consolidated\nstatement of cash flows for the year ended 31 December 2023 was adjusted to reflect the changes in the consolidated statement\nof financial position. The related special commission expense for the year ended 31 December 2023 is accordingly reclassified\nfrom due to banks and other financial institutions to customers\u2019 deposits in note 21.\nFurther, special commission paid on debt securities in issue have been reclassified from financing activities to operating activities\nin the consolidated statement of cash flows to align with related classification.\nThese reclassifications have no impact on previously reported results or the equity of the Group.\n42.

GENERAL (continued)\na) During financial year 2021, Aman Insurance Agency Company (the Company) applied for its\nlicense renewal from Saudi Central Bank (\"SAMA\"), however, it was not renewed, as SAMA had\nissued rules governing bancassurance activities during May 2020 which require the banks to carry\nout Bancassurance business directly. This, as a result, restricted the ability of the Company to carry\nout business activities and therefore, management of the Company decided to initiate the winding\nup procedures which are in process as at 31 December 2024.\nb) The Group invests in structured entities with the objective to resell the investment in a short period\nafter the establishment. Structured entities are consolidated when the relationship between the\nGroup and the structured entity indicates that the Group has power over the relevant activities of\nthe structured entity, is exposed to variable returns, and can use that power to affect the variable\nreturn exposure. In other cases, the Group may sponsor or have exposure to such an entity but not\nconsolidate the entities.\nAs at 31 December 2024, the Group has a substantial ownership in these entities amounting to SR\n1,072.68 million (31 December 2023: SR 1,113.98 million). For all these investments, the Group\nanalyses whether and to what extent it controls the investee and any underlying entities. A material\nstructured entity is consolidated into the Group\u2019s financial statements where the Group controls the\nstructured entity, as per the determination above criteria. As at 31 December 2024, Group\u2019s\ninvestments in material structured entities do not meet the above criteria of control. Accordingly,\nsuch investments are recorded as fair value through statement of income (FVIS) into these\nconsolidated financial statements.\nThe details of the Bank\u2019s associate is as follows:\nOwnership Ownership\n(direct and (direct and\nindirect) indirect)\nCountry of December 31, December 31,\nincorporation Nature of business 2024 2023\nAssociate\nAlJazira Takaful Kingdom of Fully Shari\u2019ah 33.08%* 26.03%\nTa\u2019awuni Company Saudi Arabia compliant protection\nand saving products\n*This includes the Bank\u2019s standalone shareholding of 29.36% (31 December 2023: 22.31%) and AJC\u2019s shareholding\nof 3.72% (31 December 2023: 3.72%)\n14"

BASIS OF PREPARATION\na) Basis of preparation\ni. Statement of compliance\nThese consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2024\nand 31 December 2023, respectively, have been prepared;\n- in accordance with the accordance with the IFRS Accounting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d) as issued by\nInternational Accounting Standards Board and endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and in\ncompliance with other standards and pronouncements endorsed by the Saudi Organization for\nChartered and Professional Accountants (\u201cSOCPA\u201d), and\n- in compliance with the provisions of Banking Control Law, the Regulations for Companies in the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia and By-Laws of the Bank.\nii. Basis of measurement and presentation\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the\nhistorical cost convention except for the measurement at fair value of derivatives, financial instruments\nheld as Fair Value through Income Statement (FVIS), Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income\n(FVOCI) and liabilities for employee benefit obligations carried at present values of future cashflows\ncalculated using Projected Unit Credit Method. In addition, financial assets or liabilities that are hedged\nin a fair value hedging relationship, and otherwise carried at cost, are carried at fair value to the extent\nof the risk being hedged.\nThe consolidated statement of financial position is stated broadly in order of liquidity.\niii. Functional and presentation currency\nThese consolidated financial statements are presented in Saudi Arabian Riyals (SR), which is the Bank\u2019s\nfunctional and presentation currency. Except as otherwise indicated, financial information presented in\nSR has been rounded off to the nearest thousand.\nEach entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial\nstatements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. The functional currency of all\nthe subsidiaries of the Bank is the Saudi Arabian Riyal (SR) except for AlJazira Securities Limited\nwhose functional currency is US Dollars.\nb) Basis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Bank and its subsidiaries.\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as that of the Bank,\nusing consistent accounting policies.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies and\nvaluation methods for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. The accounting\npolicies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by\nthe Group.\ni. Subsidiaries\nSubsidiaries are entities which are controlled by the Bank. The Bank controls an entity when it is\nexposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to\naffect those returns through its power over the entity. To meet the definition of control, all the following\nthree criteria must be met:\n15"

BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued)\nb) Basis of consolidation (continued)\ni. Subsidiaries (continued)\na) the Group has power over an entity;\nb) the Group has exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity; and\nc) the Group has the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the amount of the entity's\nreturns.\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee in case facts and circumstances indicate\nthat there are changes to one or more of the criteria of control.\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Bank and cease to be\nconsolidated from the date on which the control is transferred from the Bank. The results of subsidiaries\nacquired or disposed of during the year, if any, are included in the consolidated statement of income\nfrom the date of the acquisition or up to the date of disposal, as appropriate.\nii. Non-controlling interests\nNon-controlling interests represent the portion of net income and net assets of subsidiaries not owned,\ndirectly or indirectly, by the Bank in its subsidiaries and are presented separately in the consolidated\nstatement of income and within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position, separately\nfrom the Bank\u2019s equity. Any losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are\nallocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a\ndeficit balance. Changes in the Bank\u2019s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are\naccounted for as equity transactions.\niii. Transactions eliminated on consolidation\nIntra-group balances, and any unrealised income and expenses (except for foreign currency transaction\ngains or losses) arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to\nthe extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\niv. Investment in an associate\nAssociates are entities over which the Group exercises significant influence. Investments in associates\nare initially recognized at cost and subsequently accounted for under the equity method of accounting\nand are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at the lower of the equity-accounted\nvalue or the recoverable amount.\nEquity-accounted value represents the cost-plus post-acquisition changes in the Group\u2019s share of net\nassets of the associate (share of the results, reserves and accumulated gains / (losses) based on the latest\navailable financial information) less impairment, if any.\nAfter application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an\nadditional impairment loss on its investment in its associates. The Group determines at each reporting\ndate whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is\nthe case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable\namount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount in \u2018share in net income / (loss)\nof an associate\u2019 in the consolidated statement of income.\nThe previously recognized impairment loss in respect of investment in associate can be reversed through\nthe consolidated statement of income, such that the carrying amount of the investment in the\nconsolidated statement of financial position remains at the lower of the equity-accounted (before\nallowance for impairment) or the recoverable amount.\nUnrealized gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the\nextent of the Group\u2019s interest in the associates.\n16"

BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued)\nc) Critical accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as endorsed in the\nKSA and in compliance with other standards and pronouncements issued by SOCPA, requires the use\nof certain critical accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying\nthe Group\u2019s accounting policies. Such judgments, estimates, and assumptions are continually evaluated\nand are based on historical experience and other factors, including obtaining professional advices and\nexpectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nThe Group has made various accounting estimates in these financial statements based on forecasts of\neconomic conditions which reflect expectations and assumptions as at 31 December 2024 about future\nevents that the Group believe are reasonable in the circumstances. There is a considerable degree of\njudgement involved in preparing these estimates. The underlying assumptions are also subject to\nuncertainties which are often outside the control of the Group. Accordingly, actual economic conditions\nare likely to be different from those forecast since anticipated events frequently do not occur as\nexpected, and the effect of those differences may significantly impact accounting estimates included in\nthese financial statements.\nThe significant accounting estimates impacted by these forecasts and associated uncertainties are\npredominantly related to expected credit losses, fair value measurement and the assessment of the\nrecoverable amount of non-financial assets.\nRevisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the\nrevision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and in future periods if the revision affects\nboth current and future periods. Significant areas where management has used estimates, assumptions\nor exercised judgments are as follows:\ni. Business model assessment (note 3(c)(i)(a))\nii. Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and profit (SPPI) (note\n3(c)(i)(b))\niii. Classification of financial assets (note 3(c)(i))\niv. Impairment losses on financial assets (note 2(c)(i))\nv. Fair value measurement (note 2(c)(ii))\nvi. Impairment of non-financial assets (note 2(c)(iii))\nvii.

BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued)\nc) Critical accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions (continued)\ni. Impairment losses on financial assets\nThe measurement of expected credit loss (ECL) under IFRS 9 across all categories of financial assets\nrequires judgment, in particular, for the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows and\ncollateral values when determining impairment losses and the assessment of a significant increase in\ncredit risk. These estimates are driven by a number of factors, changes in which can result in different\nlevels of allowances.\nThe Group\u2019s ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying\nassumptions regarding the choice of variable inputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL\nmodels that are considered accounting judgments and estimates include:\n1) the selection of an estimation technique or modelling methodology, covering below key judgments\nand assumptions:\n- The Group\u2019s internal credit grading model, which assigns probability of default (PDs) to the\nindividual grades\n- The Group\u2019s criteria for assessing if there has been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) and\nso allowances for financial assets should be measured on a lifetime ECL basis and the qualitative\nassessment\n- The segmentation of financial assets when their ECL is assessed on a collective basis\n- Development of ECL models, including the various formulas and the choice of inputs\n- Selection of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios and their probability weightings, to derive\nthe economic inputs into the ECL models\n2) the selection of inputs for those models, and the interdependencies between those inputs such as\nmacroeconomic scenarios and economic inputs.\nii. Fair value of financial instruments\nThe Group measures the financial instruments, such as derivatives, financial instruments held at fair\nvalue through income statement (FVIS) and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI),\nat their fair value at each statement of financial position date. Also, fair values of financial instruments\nmeasured at amortized cost are disclosed in note 6 (d) and note 36 (b).\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principle or, in its absence, the\nmost advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The Fair value of a liability\nreflects its non-performance risk.\nWhen one is available, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted prices in an\nactive market for that instrument. A market is regarded as \u2018active\u2019 if transactions for the asset or liability\ntake place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nIf there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Group uses the valuation techniques that\nmaximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen\nvaluation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in\npricing a transaction.\n18"

BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued)\nc) Critical accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions (continued)\nii. Fair value of financial instruments (continued)\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset considers a market participant's ability to generate\neconomic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market\nparticipant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are\ncategorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is\nsignificant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n- Level 1 \u2014 Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n- Level 2 \u2014 Inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable either directly (i.e.\nas prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This category includes instruments valued using:\nquoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for identical or similar\ninstruments in markets that are considered less than active or other valuation techniques in which\nall significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data\n- Level 3 \u2014 Inputs that are unobservable. This category include all instruments for which the\nvaluation technique include inputs that are not observable and the unobservable inputs have a\nsignificant effect on the instrument\u2019s valuation. This category includes instruments that are valued\nbased on quoted prices for similar instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or\nassumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognised in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis,\nthe Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing\ncategorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a\nwhole) at the end of each reporting period.\nFor the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the\nbasis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value\nhierarchy.\niii. Impairment of non-financial assets\nThe carrying amounts of non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date or more frequently to\ndetermine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset\u2019s\nrecoverable amount is estimated.\nAn impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds\nits recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its\nvalue in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows\nare discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments\nof the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The fair value less cost to sell is based on\nobservable market prices or, if no observable market prices exist, estimated prices for similar assets or if\nno estimated prices for similar assets are available, then based on discounted future cash flow\ncalculations.\n19"

BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued)\nc) Critical accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions (continued)\niii. Impairment of non-financial assets (continued)\nWhen subsidiaries are sold, the difference between the selling price and the net assets plus cumulative\nforeign currency translation reserve and unimpaired goodwill is recognised in the consolidated statement\nof income.\nOther real estates are revalued through independent real estate evaluators on a periodic basis and any\nunrealised losses on revaluation are recognised in the consolidated statement of income.\nIn respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting\ndate for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if\nthere has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.\nAn impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset\u2019s carrying amount does not exceed the\ncarrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment\nloss had been recognised.\niv Determination of control over investment funds\nThe Group acts as Fund Manager to a number of investment funds. Determining whether the Group\ncontrols such an investment fund usually focuses on the assessment of the aggregate economic interests\nof the Group in the Fund (comprising any carried interests and expected management fees) and the\ninvestors\u2019 rights to remove the Fund Manager. As a result, the Group has concluded that it acts as an\nagent for the investors in all cases, and therefore has not consolidated these funds.\nv Provisions for liabilities and charges\nThe Group receives legal claims in the ordinary course of business. Management makes judgments in\nassigning the risk that might exists in such claims. It also sets appropriate provisions against probable\nlosses. The claims are recorded or disclosed, as appropriate, in the consolidated financial statements\nbased on the best estimate of the amount required to settle the claim.\nvi Going concern\nThe Group\u2019s management has made an assessment of the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern\nand is satisfied that the Group and the Bank have the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable\nfuture. Furthermore, management is not aware of any material uncertainties that may cast significant\ndoubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the consolidated financial\nstatements continue to be prepared on a going concern basis.\nvii. Employee Benefit Obligation\nThe Group operates an end of service benefit plan (the plan) for its employees based on the prevailing\nSaudi Labour laws. The liability for the plan is estimated in accordance with International Accounting\nStandard (IAS) 19 \u2013 Employee Benefits as endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, by a qualified\nactuary based on various assumptions. The key assumptions used to estimate the plan liability at the year\nend, are disclosed in note 30 to these consolidated financial statements.\n20"

Classification of financial assets (continued)\na) Business model assessment (continued)\n- the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice.\nIn particular, whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual profit, maintaining\na particular profit rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of\nthe liabilities that are funding those assets or realizing cash flows through the sale of the assets;\n- how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management;\n- the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within\nthat business model) and how those risks are managed;\n- how managers of the business are compensated- e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair\nvalue of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and\n- the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its\nexpectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not\nconsidered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Group's stated objective\nfor managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realized.\nThe business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or\n'stress case\u2019 scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is\ndifferent from the Group's original expectations, the Group does not change the classification of the\nremaining financial assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing\nnewly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward.\nFinancial assets that are held for trading and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are\nmeasured at FVIS because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect\ncontractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.\nb) Assessments whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and Profit\n(SPPI)\nFor the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition.\n'Profit\u2019 is the consideration for the time value of money, the credit and other basic lending risks associated\nwith the principal amount outstanding during a particular period and other basic lending costs (e.g.\nliquidity risk and administrative costs), along with profit margin.\nIn assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and profit, the Group\nconsiders the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset\ncontains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it\nwould not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Group considers:\n- contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;\n- leverage features;\n- prepayment and extension terms;\n- terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse asset\narrangements); and\n- features that modify consideration of the time value of money- e.g. periodical reset of profit\nrates.\n26"

Derecognition\nFinancial assets\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset, such as a financing to a customer, when the terms and\nconditions have been renegotiated to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new financing, with the\ndifference recognised as a derecognition gain or loss, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already\nbeen recorded. The newly recognised financings are classified as Stage 1 for ECL measurement purposes,\nunless the new financing is deemed to be POCI.\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial\nasset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which\nsubstantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which\nthe Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does\nnot retain control of the financial asset.\nOn derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the\ncarrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognized) and the sum of (i) the consideration\nreceived (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain\nor loss that had been recognized in OCI is recognized in profit or loss. Any cumulative gain/loss\nrecognized in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated as at FVOCI is not recognized in\nprofit or loss on derecognition of such securities. Any interest in transferred financial assets that qualify\nfor derecognition that is created or retained by the Group is recognized as a separate asset or liability.\nWhen assets are sold to a third party with a concurrent total rate of return swap on the transferred assets,\nthe transaction is accounted for as a secured financing transaction similar to sale-and repurchase\ntransactions, as the Group retains all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of such\nassets.\nIn transactions in which the Group neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards\nof ownership of a financial asset and it retains control over the asset, the Group continues to recognize\nthe asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to\nchanges in the value of the transferred asset.\nIn certain transactions, the Group retains the obligation to service the transferred financial asset for a fee.\nThe transferred asset is derecognized if it meets the derecognition criteria. An asset or liability is\nrecognized for the servicing contract if the servicing fee is more than adequate (asset) or is less than\nadequate (liability) for performing the servicing.\nFinancial liabilities\nThe Group derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled,\nor expire.\n28"

Modifications of financial assets and financial liabilities\nFinancial assets\nIf the terms of a financial asset are modified, the Group evaluates whether the cash flows of the modified\nasset are substantially different. If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to\ncash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial\nasset is derecognized with the difference recognized as a de-recognition gain or loss and a new financial\nasset is recognized at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the\nmodification are accounted for as follows:\na) Fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new financial asset and fees that\nrepresents reimbursement of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of\nthe asset; and\nb) Other fees are included in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.\nIf the cash flows of the modified asset carried at amortized cost are not substantially different, then the\nmodification does not result in derecognition of the financial asset. In this case, the Group recalculates\nthe gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective profit rate of the asset and\nrecognizes the amount arising from adjusting the gross carrying amount as a modification gain or loss in\nstatement of income. For floating-rate financial assets, the original effective profit rate used to calculate\nthe modification gain or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification.\nAny costs of fees incurred and modification fees received adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified\nfinancial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.\nFinancial liabilities\nThe Group derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the\nmodified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified\nterms is recognized at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability\nextinguished and the new financial liability with modified terms is recognized in consolidated statement\nof income.\nIf the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortized cost\nof the liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective profit rate\nand the resulting gain or loss is recognized in consolidated statement of income. For financial liabilities,\nthe Group considers a modification to be substantial based on qualitative factors and if it results in a\ndifference between the adjusted discounted present value and the original carrying amount of the financial\nliability of, or greater than, ten percent.\n29"

Impairment (continued)\nMeasurement of ECL\nECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:\n- financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash\nshortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract\nand the cash flows that the Group expects to receive);\n- financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross\ncarrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows;\n- undrawn credit related commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual\ncash flows that are due to the Group if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the\nGroup expects to receive; and\n- financial guarantee contracts: the expected payments to reimburse the holder less any amounts that\nthe Group expects to recover.\nWhen discounting future cash flows, the following discount rates are used:\n- financial assets other than purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets and Ijarah\nreceivables: the original effective profit rate or an approximation thereof;\n- POCI assets: a credit-adjusted effective profit rate\n- Ijarah receivables: the discount rate used in measuring Ijarah receivables.\n- Undrawn credit related commitments: the effective profit rate, or an approximation thereof, that will\nbe applied to the financial asset resulting from the credit related commitment; and\n- Financial Guarantee contracts issued: the rate that reflects the current market assessment of the time\nvalue of money and the risks that are specific to the cash flows.\nRestructured financial assets\nIf the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced\nwith a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the\nfinancial asset should be derecognized and ECL are measured as follows:\n- if the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected\ncash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls\nfrom the existing asset.\n- if the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair\nvalue of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of\nits derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing\nfinancial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using\nthe original effective yield rate of the existing financial asset.\n-\n31"

Impairment (continued)\nCredit-impaired financial assets\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost and finance\nlease receivables are credit-impaired. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that\nhave detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.\nEvidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;\n- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;\n- the restructuring of a financing or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider\notherwise;\n- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; or\n- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\nA financing that has been renegotiated due to deterioration in the borrower's condition is usually\nconsidered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash\nflows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a retail\nfinancing that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered impaired.\nIn making an assessment of whether an investment in sovereign debt is credit-impaired, the Group\nconsiders the following factors:\n- the market's assessment of creditworthiness as reflected in the sukuk yields.\n- the rating agencies' assessments of creditworthiness.\n- the country's ability to access the capital markets for new debt issuance.\n- the probability of debt being restructured, resulting in holders suffering losses through voluntary or\nmandatory debt forgiveness.\n- the international support mechanisms in place to provide the necessary support as 'lender of last\nresort' to that country, as well as the intention, reflected in public statements, of governments and\nagencies to use those mechanisms. This includes an assessment of the depth of those mechanisms\nand, irrespective of the political intent, whether there is the capacity to fulfil the required criteria.\nPOCI financial assets\nPOCI financial assets are assets that are credit-impaired on initial recognition. For POCI assets, lifetime\nECL are incorporated into the calculation of the effective profit rate on initial recognition.\nConsequently, POCI assets do not carry impairment allowance on initial recognition. The amount\nrecognized as a loss allowance subsequent to initial recognition is equal to the changes in lifetime ECL\nsince initial recognition of the asset.\n32"

Impairment (continued)\nCredit cards and other revolving facilities\nThe Group\u2019s product offering includes a variety of corporate and retail overdraft and credit cards facilities,\nin which the Group has the right to cancel and/or reduce the facilities with one day\u2019s notice. ECL\nestimation is based on expectations of customer behaviour, the likelihood of default and its future risk\nmitigation procedures, which could include reducing or cancelling the facilities. Based on past experience\nand the Group\u2019s expectations, the period over which the Group calculates the ECL for facilities within\nthese products as per the actual remaining maturity of the facilities for stage 2 and 3 customers, and\ncapped to twelve month maturity for stage 1 customers. The ongoing assessment of whether a significant\nincrease in credit risk has occurred for revolving facilities is similar to other lending products, primarily\nbased on delinquency-based criteria.\nThe profit rate used to discount the ECL for credit cards is based on the average effective profit rate that\nis expected to be charged over the expected period of exposure to the facilities. The calculation of ECL,\nincluding the estimation of the expected period of exposure and discount rate is made, on an individual\nbasis for commercial and rconsumer products.\nPresentation of allowance for ECL in the consolidated statement of financial position\nLoss allowances for ECL are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position as follows:\n- financial assets measured at amortized cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the\nassets;\n- credit related commitments and financial guarantee contracts: generally, as a provision;\n- where a financial instrument includes both a drawn and an undrawn component, and the Group\ncannot identify the ECL on the credit related commitment component separately from those on the\ndrawn component, the Group presents a combined loss allowance for both components. The\ncombined amount is presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the drawn\ncomponent. Any excess of the loss allowance over the gross amount of the drawn component is\npresented as a provision under \u201cother liabilities\u201d; and\n- debt instruments measured at FVOCI: no loss allowance is recognized in the statement of financial\nposition because the carrying amount of these assets is their fair value. However, the loss allowance\nis disclosed and is recognized in the fair value reserve.

Impairment (continued)\nWrite-off\nFinancing and debt securities are written off (either partially or fully) when there is no reasonable\nexpectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirely or a portion thereof. This is generally the case\nwhen the Group determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could\ngenerate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried\nout at the individual assets level. If the amount to be written off is greater than the accumulated loss\nallowance, the difference is first treated as an addition to the allowance that is then applied against the\ngross carrying amount.\nRecoveries of amounts previously written off are recognised when the cash is received and are included\nin \u201cImpairment charge for financing and other financial assets, net\u201d in the statement of income\nFinancial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply\nwith the Group\u2019s procedures for recovery of amounts due.\u201d\nCollateral valuation\nTo mitigate its credit risks on financial assets, the Group seeks to use collateral, where possible.

It is generally assessed, at a\nminimum, at inception and re-assessed on a periodic basis. However, some collateral, for example, cash\nor securities relating to margining requirements, is valued daily.\nTo the extent possible, the Group uses active market data for valuing financial assets held as collateral.\nOther financial assets which do not have readily determinable market values are valued using models.\nNon-financial collateral, such as real estate, is valued based on data provided by third parties such as\nprofessional evaluators or based on housing price indices.\nd) Financial guarantees, letters of credit and financing commitments\n\u2018Financial guarantees' are contracts that require the Group to make specified payments to reimburse the\nholder for a loss that it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when it is due in\naccordance with the terms of a debt instrument.\nThe premium received is recognised in the income statement in Fees from banking services, net on a\nstraight line basis over the life of the guarantee.\n'Financing commitments and letters of credit' are firm commitments under which, over the duration of\nthe commitments, the Group is required to provide credit under pre-specified terms and conditions\nSimilar to financial guarantee contracts, these contracts are in the scope of the ECL requirements.\n34"

Subsequently, they are measured at the higher of the loss allowance determined\nin accordance with IFRS 9 and the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, the cumulative\namount of income recognized in accordance with the principle of ISFRS 15. Other loan commitments\nissued are measured at the sum of (i) the loss allowance determined in accordance with IFRS 9 and (ii)\nthe amount of any fees received, less, if the commitment is unlikely to result in a specific lending\narrangement, the cumulative amount of income recognized.\nThe Group has issued no credit related commitments that are measured at FVIS. For other credit related\ncommitments the Group recognizes loss allowance as a provision under \u201cother liabilities\u201d.\ne) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\nDerivative financial instruments including forward rate agreements, profit rate swaps and profit rate\noptions (both written and purchased) are initially measured at their fair value on the date on which the\nderivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value in the consolidated\nstatement of financial position. The transaction costs associated with these agreements are recognised\nin the consolidated statement of income.\nAll derivatives are carried at their fair value as assets, where the fair value is positive, and as liabilities,\nwhere the fair value is negative. Fair values are obtained by reference to quoted market prices,\ndiscounted cash flow models and pricing models, as appropriate.\nThe treatment of changes in their fair value depends on their classification into the following categories:\ni. Derivatives held for trading\nAny changes in the fair value of derivatives that are held for trading purposes are taken directly to the\nconsolidated statement of income and disclosed in \u201cGain / (Loss) on FVIS Financial Instruments, net\u201d.\nDerivatives held for trading also includes those derivatives, which do not qualify for hedge accounting.\nii. Embedded derivatives\nDerivatives may be embedded in another contractual arrangement (a host contract). The Group accounts\nfor an embedded derivative separately from the host contract when:\na) the host contract is not an asset in the scope of IFRS 9;\nb) the terms of the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative if they were\ncontained in a separate contract; and\nc) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the\neconomic characteristics and risks of the host contract.\nSeparated embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value recognized in\nconsolidated statement of income unless they form part of a qualifying cash flow or net investment\nhedging relationship. Separated embedded derivatives are presented in the statement of financial\nposition together with the host contract.\n35"

Hedge Accounting\nAs permitted by the IFRS 9, the Group has elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting\nrequirements of IAS 39.\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in qualifying hedging relationships to\nmanage exposures to profit rates and foreign currencies. In order to manage risks, the Group applies\nhedge accounting for transactions that meet specific criteria.\nFor the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified into following two categories:\na) Fair value hedges which hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset\nor liability, (or assets or liabilities in case of portfolio hedging), or an unrecognised firm\ncommitment or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is\nattributable to a particular risk and could affect the reported net gain or loss; and\nb) Cash flow hedges which hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to\na particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or to a highly probable forecasted\ntransaction that will affect the reported net gain or loss.\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge should be expected to be highly effective, i.e. the\nchanges in fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument should effectively offset corresponding\nchanges in the hedged item and should be reliably measurable. At inception of the hedge, the risk\nmanagement objective and strategy are documented including the identification of the hedging\ninstrument, the related hedged item, the nature of risk being hedged, and how the Group will assess the\neffectiveness of the hedging relationship. Subsequently, the hedge is required to be assessed and\ndetermined to be an effective hedge on an on-going basis.\nAt each hedge effectiveness assessment date, a hedge relationship must be expected to be highly\neffective on a prospective basis and demonstrate that it was effective (retrospective effectiveness) for\nthe designated period in order to qualify for hedge accounting. A formal assessment is undertaken by\ncomparing the hedging instrument\u2019s effectiveness in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows\nattributable to the hedged risk in the hedged item, both at inception and at each quarter end on an ongoing\nbasis. A hedge is expected to be highly effective if the changes in fair value or cash flows attributable\nto the hedged risk during the period for which the hedge is designated were offset by the hedging\ninstrument in a range of 80% to 125% and were expected to achieve such offset in future periods. Hedge\nineffectiveness is recognized in the statement of income in \u2018net gain on FVIS financial instruments\u2019.\nFor situations where the hedged item is a forecast transaction, the Group also assesses whether the\ntransaction is highly probable and presents an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately\naffect the statement of income.\nFair Value Hedges\nWhen a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the change in fair value of a\nrecognised asset or liability or a firm commitment that could affect the consolidated statement of\nincome, changes in fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement\nof income together with change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk under\nnon-trading gains / losses in the consolidated statement of income.\n36"

Hedge Accounting (continued)\nFair Value Hedges (continued)\nFor hedged items measured at amortised cost, where the fair value hedge of a profit bearing financial\ninstrument ceases to meet the criteria for hedge accounting or is sold, exercised or terminated, the\ndifference between the carrying value of the hedged item on termination and the face value is amortised\nover the remaining term of the original hedge using the effective yield rate method. If the hedged item\nis derecognised, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the consolidated\nstatement of income.\nCash Flow Hedges\nFor designated and qualifying cash flow hedging, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging\ninstrument that is determined to be an effective portion is recognised directly under \u201cother reserve\u201d in\nconsolidated statement of comprehensive income and the ineffective portion, if any, is recognised in\nthe consolidated statement of income. For cash flow hedges affecting future transactions, the gains or\nlosses recognised in other reserves, are transferred to the consolidated statement of income in the same\nperiod in which the hedged item affects the consolidated statement of income. However, if the Group\nexpects that all or a portion of a loss recognized in other comprehensive income will not be recovered\nin one or more future periods, it reclassifies into the consolidated statement of income as a\nreclassification adjustment the amount that is not to be recognized.\nWhen the hedging instrument is expired or sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for\nhedge accounting, or the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur or the Group revokes the\ndesignation, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. At that point of time, any cumulative\ngain or loss on the cash flow hedging instrument that was recognised in other comprehensive income\nfrom the period when the hedge was effective is transferred from equity to statement of income when\nthe forecasted transaction occurs. Where the hedged forecasted transaction is no longer expected to\noccur and affects the statement of income, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in consolidated\nstatement of comprehensive income is transferred immediately to the consolidated statement of income.\nIn accordance with risk management policies, the Group manages its cash flow profit rate risk on an\nentity-wide basis as well as variability of profit rate on Wakala floating rates notes. The Group designate\nprofit rate swaps as hedging instrument against the cash flow risk resulting from a change in profit rates\nthat occurs up to the repricing of the swap.\nThe Group first assesses forecasting of the \u201cnet cash flow\u201d exposures from existing yield bearing assets\nand liabilities, including the rollover of short-term assets and short-term liabilities. This is mainly\nachieved through yield sensitivity gap. During forecasting of the net cash flows, the Group take into\naccount historic information and market trends for withdrawal of deposits, yield rates and refinancing\u2019s\nand repricing\u2019s. The net cash flows are then compared with existing hedging positions to provide a basis\nfor considering whether adjustment of the hedging relationship should be made.\n37"

Hedge Accounting (continued)\nCash Flow Hedges (continued)\nThe notional amounts of the profit rate swaps that are outstanding at the analysis date are included in\neach of the periods in which the profit rate swaps are outstanding to assess the impact of the outstanding\nprofit rate swaps on the identified cash flow exposures. While a portion of the forecast transaction is no\nlonger being hedged, the profit rate swap is not de-designated, and it continues to be a hedging\ninstrument for the remaining transactions in the series that have not occurred. However, if the next\nforecast transaction does not occur until specified period, the remaining after the repricing of the profit\nrate swap, is not hedged.\nThe Group designates the hedging relationship in a manner that also consider the extent to which\nineffectiveness is expected to be recognised for accounting purposes. The hedged exposure percentage\nis computed as the ratio of the notional amount of the receive-fixed, pay-variable swaps that are\noutstanding divided by the gross exposure. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging\ninstrument is initially recognized directly in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion of the\ngain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized immediately in \u201ctrading income, net\u201d. For cash\nflow hedges affecting future transactions, the gains or losses recognised in other reserves are transferred\nto the consolidated statement of income in the same period in which the hedge transactions affect the\nconsolidated statement of income.\nf) Foreign Currencies\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into Saudi Arabian Riyals (SR) at exchange rates\nprevailing on the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities at the year-end (other than\nmonetary items that form part of the net investment in a foreign operation), denominated in foreign\ncurrencies, are translated into SR at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date.\nForeign exchange gains or losses from settlement of transactions and translation of year end monetary\nassets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated statement of\nincome. Translation gains or losses on non-monetary items carried at fair value are included as part of\nthe fair value adjustment either in the consolidated statement of income or in other comprehensive\nincome depending on the underlying financial asset.\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated\nusing the exchange rates as at the dates of initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair\nvalue in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is\ndetermined.\nIn determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income\n(or part of it) on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability relating to advance\nconsideration, the date of the transaction is the date on which the Group initially recognises the non-\nmonetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the advance consideration. If there are multiple\npayments or receipts in advance, the Group determines the transaction date for each payment or receipt\nof advance consideration.\n38"

The 'effective yield rate' is the rate that exactly\ndiscounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument\nto the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or the amortized cost of the financial liability.\nWhen calculating the effective yield rate for financial instruments other than credit-impaired assets, the\nGroup estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not\nexpected credit losses. For credit-impaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted effective yield rate is\ncalculated using estimated future cash flows including expected credit losses.\nThe calculation of the effective yield rate includes transaction costs and fees and points paid or received\nthat are an integral part of the effective yield rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are\ndirectly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability.\nMeasurement of amortized cost\nThe 'amortized cost' of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or\nfinancial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the\ncumulative amortization using the effective yield method of any difference between that initial amount\nand the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance.\nThe 'gross carrying amount of a financial asset' is the amortized cost of a financial asset before adjusting\nfor any expected credit loss allowance.\nIn calculating revenue and expenses related to profit bearing financial instruments, the effective yield rate\nis applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the\namortized cost of the liability.\n39"

The benefit of a\ngovernment deposit at a below-market rate of profit is treated as a government grant related to income.\nThe below-market rate deposit is recognised and measured in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial\nInstruments. The benefit of the below-market rate of profit is measured as the difference between the\ninitial carrying value of the deposit determined in accordance with IFRS 9 and the proceeds received. The\nbenefit is accounted for in accordance with IAS 20. Government grant is recognised in statement of\nconsolidated income on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Group recognises as expenses the\nrelated costs for which the grant is intended to compensate.

Where the Group is the lessee\nRight of use asset / lease liabilities\nOn initial recognition, at inception of the contract, the Group shall assess whether the contract is, or\ncontains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of\nan identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control is identified if most of the\nbenefits are flowing to the Group and the Group can direct the usage of such assets.\nRight of use assets\nThe Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the\nunderlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated\ndepreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities for lease\nmodifications. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial\ndirect costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease\nincentives received. Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the\nend of the lease term, the recognised right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the\nshorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are\ndetermined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. Right-of-use assets are subject to\nimpairment.\nLease liability\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present\nvalue of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments\n(including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that\ndepend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease\npayments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the\nGroup and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising\nthe option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised\nas expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\nIn calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the\nlease commencement date if the profit rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the\ncommencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of finance cost\nand reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is re-\nmeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease\npayments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.\nShort-term leases and leases of low-value assets\nThe Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases\nthat have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase\noption). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment\nthat are considered of low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are\nrecognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n44"

The cost of\nproviding benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined using the projected unit credit method to\ndetermine the Group\u2019s present value of the obligations.\nThe defined benefit liability comprises the present value of defined benefit obligations as adjusted for any\npast service cost not yet recognized and any unrecognized actuarial gains/losses. The liability is included\nin \u2018other liabilities\u2019 in the consolidated statement of financial position.\nShort term benefits\nShort term employee benefits are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related\nservice is provided.\nA liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short term cash bonus or profit-sharing\nplans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past\nservice provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n45"

Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with\nrespect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions,\nwhere appropriate, on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.\nAdjustments arising from the final income tax assessments are recorded in the period in which such\nassessments are made.\nWithholding tax\nWithholding tax is withheld from payments made to non-resident vendors for services rendered and goods\npurchased according to the tax law applicable in Saudi Arabia and are directly paid to the ZATCA on a\nmonthly basis.\nValue Added Tax (VAT)\nOutput VAT related to revenue is payable to tax authorities on the earlier of:\n(a) collection of receivables from customers or\n(b) delivery of services to customers.\nInput VAT is generally recoverable against output VAT upon receipt of the VAT invoice. The tax\nauthorities permit the settlement of VAT on a net basis. VAT related to sales/services and purchases is\nrecognised in the statement of financial position on a gross basis and disclosed separately as an asset and\na liability. Where provision has been made for ECL of receivables, the impairment loss is recorded for\nthe gross amount of the debtor, including VAT.\nVAT that is not recoverable is charged to the statement of income as expense\nDeferred income tax\nDeferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the\ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for the\ntaxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realization or\nsettlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities using the tax rates enacted or substantively\nenacted at the reporting date. A deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that\nfuture taxable profits will be available and the credits can be utilized. Deferred tax asset is reduced to the\nextent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realized.\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying\namount and tax bases of investments in foreign operations where the Group is able to control the timing\nof the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the\nforeseeable future.\n46"

Current tax\nassets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends\neither to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items\nrecognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognized.\nZakat\nThe Group is subject to Zakat in accordance with the regulations of Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority\n(\u201cZATCA\u201d).

Such information is available for all customers at Bank\u2019s website,\nbranches, and call centre.\nUnder Wakala arrangement, Bank accepts funds from investors as Wakeel and invests in Shari\u2019ah\ncompliant assets. Wakeel is entitled to a fixed fee as a lump sum or percentage of fund provided. Expected\nprofit pay-out is mentioned to investors upfront while any return generated in excess of expected profit is\nretained by the Bank as Wakeel. Wakeel should bear the loss in case of Wakeel\u2019s default, negligence or\nviolation of any terms and conditions of the Wakala agreement, otherwise the loss would be borne by the\ninvestor or Muwakil.\nThe Bank maintains necessary reserves as required by SAMA.\nAny profits accrued out of the investment are shared between the two parties on a pre-agreed basis, while\nloss (if any) is borne by the Investor (Rab-ul-Maal). Operating expenses incurred by the Bank are not\ncharged to investment account. In case of the loss resulting from the transactions in a jointly financed\ninvestment, such loss shall first be deducted from undistributed profits, if any. Any excess of such loss\nshall be deducted from Investment Risk Reserve (IRR).\n47"

SHARI\u2019AH COMPLIANT DERIVATIVES\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Group utilizes the following Shari\u2019ah derivative financial\ninstruments for both trading and strategic hedging purposes:\n11.1 Nature/type of derivatives held\na) Swaps\nSwaps are commitments to exchange one set of cash flows for another. For profit rate swaps,\ncounterparties generally exchange fixed and floating rate profit payments in a single currency\nwithout exchanging principal. For cross-currency profit rate swaps, principal, fixed and floating\nprofit payments are exchanged in different currencies.\nb) Options (Wa\u2019ad Fx)\nForeign exchange options are transactions, whereby a client, in consideration for the payment of\na fee agrees to enter into one or a series of trades in which one party (promisor) gives a\ncommitment as a unilateral undertaking, to a second party (promisee).\nAn option can be a unilateral promise or combination of promises. The Group enters into the\noption depending on the client\u2019s risk profile, whereby the client may promise to buy, sell or buy\nand sell a currency with or without conditions for hedging its exposure.\n11.2 Purpose of derivatives\na) Held for trading purposes\nMost of the Group\u2019s derivative trading activities relate to sales, positioning and arbitrage. Sales\nactivities involve offering products to customers in order, to enable them to transfer, modify or\nreduce current and future risks. Positioning involves managing market risk positions with the\nexpectation of profiting from favourable movements in prices, rates or indices. Arbitrage involves\nidentifying, with the expectation of profiting from, price differentials between markets or\nproducts.\nb) Held for hedging purposes\nThe Group uses Shari\u2019ah compliant derivatives for hedging purposes in order to reduce its\nexposure to profit rate risk and foreign exchange risk.\nThe Group has adopted a comprehensive system for the measurement and management of risk.\nPart of the risk management process involves managing the Group\u2019s exposure to fluctuations in\nforeign exchange and profit rates to reduce its exposure to currency and profit rate risks to\nacceptable levels as determined by the Board of Directors within the guidelines issued by SAMA.\nAs part of its asset and liability management, the Group uses derivatives for hedging purposes in\norder to adjust its own exposure to currency and profit rate risk. This is generally achieved by\nhedging specific transactions.\n70"

TIER 1 SUKUK\nDuring the year 2021, the Bank issued cross border Tier 1 Sukuk (the \u201cSukuk) through a Shari\u2019ah\ncompliant arrangement (\u201cthe arrangement\u201d) amounting to SR 1.875 billion (denominated in US Dollars).\nThis arrangement was approved by the regulatory authorities and the Board of Directors of the Bank. The\napplicable profit rate is 3.95% per annum from date of issue up to June 2026 and is subject to reset every\n5 years.\nIn addition to the Tier 1 Sukuk issued above, during year 2023, the Bank completed the issuance of an\nSAR-denominated additional Tier 1 sukuk of SR 2 billion (which is part of additional Tier 1 Capital\nSukuk Programme of SR 5 billion) by way of a private placement in Saudi Arabia. This arrangement was\napproved by the regulatory authorities and the Board of Directors of the Bank. The applicable profit rate\nis 6% per annum from date of issue up to June 2028 and is subject to reset every 5 years.\nThese Sukuks are perpetual securities in respect of which there is no fixed redemption dates and represents\nan undivided ownership interest of the Sukuk-holders in the Sukuk assets, with each Sakk constituting an\nunsecured, conditional and subordinated obligation of the Bank classified under equity. However, the\nBank shall have the exclusive right to redeem or call the Sukuks in a specific period of time, subject to\nthe terms and conditions stipulated in the Sukuk agreement.\nThe applicable profit on the Sukuks is payable semi-annual in arrears on each periodic distribution date,\nexcept upon the occurrence of a non-payment event or non-payment election by the Bank, whereby the\nBank may at its sole discretion (subject to certain terms and conditions) elect not to make any\ndistributions. Such non-payment event or non-payment election are not considered to be events of default\nand the amounts not paid thereof shall not be cumulative or compound with any future distributions.\n78"

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\na) Legal proceedings\nAs at December 31, 2023, there were legal proceedings of routine nature outstanding against the Group. No\nsignificant provision has been made as related professional legal advice indicated that it is unlikely that any\nsignificant loss will eventually arise.\nb) Capital commitments\nAs at December 31, 2024, the Group had capital commitments of SR 276.22 million (2023: SR 245.75\nmillion) in respect of premises and IT related projects.\nc) Credit related commitments and contingencies\nThe primary purpose of these instruments is to ensure that funds are available to customers as required.\nGuarantees and standby letters of credit, which represent irrevocable assurances that the Group will make\npayments in the event that a customer cannot meet its obligations to third parties, carry the same credit risk\nas financing. Cash requirements under guarantees and standby letters of credit are considerably less than\nthe amount of the related commitment because the Group does not generally expect the third party to draw\nfunds under the agreement.\nDocumentary letters of credit, which are written undertakings by the Group on behalf of a customer\nauthorizing a third party to draw drafts on the Group up to a stipulated amount under specific terms and\nconditions, are generally collateralized by the underlying shipments of goods to which they relate and,\ntherefore, have significantly less credit risk.\nAcceptances comprise undertakings by the Group to pay bills of exchange drawn on customers. The Group\nexpects most acceptances to be presented before being reimbursed by customers.\nCommitments to extend credit represent the unused portion of authorisations to extend credit, principally in\nthe form of financing, guarantees and letters of credit. With respect to credit risk on commitments to extend\ncredit, the Group is potentially exposed to a loss in an amount equal to the total unused commitments.\nHowever, the likely amount of loss, which cannot be readily quantified, is expected to be considerably less\nthan the total unused commitments as most commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers\nmaintaining specific credit standards. The total outstanding commitments to extend credit do not necessarily\nrepresent future cash requirements, as many of the commitments could expire or terminate without being\nfunded.\n79"

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n32.1 Credit Risk\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the overall risk management approach and for approving the\nrisk management strategies and principles. The Board has set up Board Risk Committee (BRC) which has\nthe responsibility to monitor the overall risk process within the Bank.\nThe BRC has the overall responsibility for the development of the risk strategy and implementing\nprinciples, frameworks, policies and limits.\nThe BRC is responsible for supervising risk management decisions and monitoring risk levels and\nreviewing Risk Management reports / Dashboards on a regular basis. BRC is mandated to escalate to the\nBoard any risk management issue which warrants attention of the Board of Directors of the Bank.\nThe Group manages exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will\nfail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss. Credit exposures arise\nprincipally in lending activities that lead to financing, and investment activities. There is also credit risk\nin off-balance sheet financial instruments, such as credit related commitments.\nThe Group assesses the probability of default of counterparties using internal rating tools. Also, the Group\nuses the external ratings, of the major rating agency, where available.\n93"

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n32.1 Credit Risk (continued)\nThe Group attempts to control credit risk by monitoring credit exposures, limiting transactions with\nspecific counterparties, and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. The Group\u2019s risk\nmanagement policies are designed to identify and to set appropriate risk limits and to monitor the risks\nand adherence to limits. Actual exposures against limits are monitored daily. In addition to monitoring\ncredit limits, the Group manages the credit exposure relating to its trading activities by entering into master\nnetting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties in appropriate circumstances and\nlimiting the duration of exposure. In certain cases, the Group may also close out transactions or assign\nthem to other counterparties to mitigate credit risk. The Group\u2019s credit risk for derivatives represents the\npotential cost to replace the derivative contracts if counterparties fail to fulfil their obligation, and to\ncontrol the level of credit risk taken, the Group assesses counterparties using the same techniques as for\nits lending activities.\nConcentrations of credit risk arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business\nactivities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause\ntheir ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or\nother conditions.\nConcentrations of credit risk indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group\u2019s performance to developments\naffecting a particular industry or geographical location.\nThe Group seeks to manage its credit risk exposure through diversification of financing activities to ensure\nthat there is no undue concentration of risks with individuals or groups of customers in specific locations\nor business. It also takes security when appropriate. The Group also seeks additional collateral from the\ncounterparty as soon as impairment indicators are noticed for the relevant individual financing.\nManagement monitors the market value of collateral, requests additional collateral in accordance with the\nunderlying agreement and monitors the market value of collateral obtained during its review of the\nadequacy of the allowance for impairment losses.\nThe Group regularly reviews its risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in markets\nproducts and emerging best practice.\nThe debt securities included in the investment portfolio are mainly sovereign risk. Analysis of investments\nby counter-party is provided in note 6. For details of the composition of financing refer to note 7.\nInformation on credit risk relating to shari'ah compliant derivative instruments is provided in note 11 and\nfor commitments and contingencies in note 20. The information on Bank\u2019s maximum credit exposure by\nbusiness segment is given in note 31.\n94"

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n32.3 Amounts arising from ECL \u2013 Significant increase in credit risk (\u201cSICR\u201d)\nWhen determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly since\ninitial recognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and\navailable without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and\nanalysis, based on the Group's historical experience and expert credit assessment and including forward-\nlooking information.\nThe objective of the assessment is to identify whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred for\nan exposure by comparing:\n\u2022 the remaining lifetime probability of default (PD) as at the reporting date; with\n\u2022 the remaining lifetime PD for this point in time that was estimated at the time of initial recognition of\nthe exposure (adjusted where relevant for changes in prepayment expectations).\nThe Group classifies it\u2019s financing into Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3 and POCI, as described below:\nStage 1 (12 month ECL) : When a financing is first recognised, the Group recognises an allowance based\non 12 months ECLs. Stage 1 financing also include facilities where the credit risk has improved and the\nfinancing has been reclassified from Stage 2.\nStage 2 (Life time ECL not credit impaired) : When a financing has shown a significant increase in credit\nrisk (\u201cSICR\u201d) since origination, the Group records an allowance for the Lifetime ECL. Stage 2 financing\nalso include facilities, where the credit risk has improved and the financing has been reclassified from\nStage 3.\nStage 3 (Lifetime ECL credit impaired) : Financing considered credit-impaired. The Group records an\nallowance for the Lifetime ECL.\nPOCI: Purchased or originated credit impaired (POCI) assets are financial assets that are credit impaired\non initial recognition. POCI assets are recorded at fair value at original recognition and profit is\nsubsequently recognised based on a credit-adjusted effective yield rate. ECLs are only recognised or\nreleased to the extent that there is a subsequent change in the expected credit losses.\na) Determining whether credit risk has increased significantly\nThe criteria for determining whether credit risk has increased significantly vary by portfolio and include\nquantitative changes in PDs and qualitative factors, including a backstop based on delinquency. The credit\nrisk of a particular exposure is deemed to have increased significantly since initial recognition if, based\non the Group's quantitative modelling, the remaining lifetime PD is determined to have increased by more\nthan a predetermined percentage/range.\nUsing its expert credit judgment and, where possible, relevant historical experience, the Group may\ndetermine that an exposure has undergone a significant increase in credit risk based on particular\nqualitative indicators that it considers are indicative of such and whose effect may not otherwise be fully\nreflected in its quantitative analysis on a timely basis. Significant increase in credit risk is also evaluated\nbased on the credit monitoring framework, including decrease in internal rating and macroeconomic\nfactors and is subject to management overrides.\nAs a backstop, the Group considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an\nasset is more than 30 days past due. Days past due are determined by counting the number of days since\nthe earliest elapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not been received.\n101"

Credit risk grades are\ndefined using qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of risk of default. These factors vary\ndepending on the nature of the exposure and the type of borrower.\nCredit risk grades are defined and calibrated such that the risk of default occurring increases exponentially\nas the credit risk deteriorates so, for example, the difference in risk of default between credit risk grades\n1 and 2 is smaller than the difference between credit risk grades 2 and 3.\nEach corporate exposure is allocated to a credit risk grade at initial recognition based on available\ninformation about the borrower. Exposures are subject to ongoing monitoring, which may result in an\nexposure being moved to a different credit risk grade. The monitoring of exposures involves use of the\nfollowing data.\nCorporate exposures Retail exposures All exposures\n\u2022 Information obtained during \u2022 Internally collected data \u2022 Payment record \u2013 this\nperiodic review of customer files \u2013 and customer behaviour \u2013 includes overdue status as\ne.g. audited financial statements, e.g. utilization of credit well as a range of\nmanagement accounts, budgets and card facilities variables about payment\nprojections.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n32.3 Amounts arising from ECL \u2013 Significant increase in credit risk (\u201cSICR\u201d) (continued)\nb) Generating the term structure of PD\nCredit risk grades are a primary input into the determination of the term structure of PD for exposures.\nThe Group collects performance and default information about its credit risk exposures analysed by type\nof product and borrower as well as by credit risk grading. For some portfolios, information purchased\nfrom external credit reference agencies is also used.\nThe Group employs statistical models to analyse the data collected and generate estimates of the\nremaining lifetime PD of exposures and how these are expected to change as a result of the passage of\ntime.\nThis analysis includes the identification and calibration of relationships between changes in default rates\nand macro-economic factors as well as in-depth analysis of the impact of certain other factors (e.g.\nforbearance experience) on the risk of default. For most exposures, key macro-economic indicators\ninclude: GDP growth, oil prices, real wages and unemployment rates. For exposures to specific industries\nand/or regions, the analysis may extend to relevant commodity and/or real estate prices.\nBased on advice from the credit risk managers and economic experts and consideration of a variety of\nexternal actual and forecast information, the Group formulates a 'base case' view of the future direction\nof relevant economic variables as well as a representative range of other possible forecast scenarios (see\ndiscussion below on incorporation of forward-looking information). The Group then uses these forecasts\nto adjust its estimates of PDs.\nc) Definition of \u2018Default\u2019\nThe Group considers a financial asset to be in default when:\n\u2022 the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the\nGroup to actions such as realizing security (if any is held); or\n\u2022 the borrower is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the Group.\nOverdrafts are considered as being past due once the customer has breached an advised limit or\nbeen advised of a limit smaller than the current amount outstanding.\nIn assessing whether a borrower is in default. The Group considers indicators that are:\n\u2022 qualitative- e.g. breaches of covenant;\n\u2022 quantitative- e.g. overdue status and non-payment on another obligation of the same issuer to the\nGroup; and\n\u2022 based on data developed internally and obtained from external sources.\nInputs into the assessment of whether a financial instrument is in default and their significance may vary\nover time to reflect changes in circumstances.\n103"

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n32.3 Amounts arising from ECL \u2013 Significant increase in credit risk (\u201cSICR\u201d) (continued)\nd) Modified financial assets\nThe contractual terms of a financing may be modified for a number of reasons, including changing market\nconditions, customer retention and other factors not related to a current or potential credit deterioration\nof the customer. An existing financing whose terms have been modified may be derecognized and the\nrenegotiated financing recognized as a new financing at fair value in accordance with the accounting\npolicy.\nWhen the terms of a financial asset are modified and the modification does not result in de-recognition,\nthe determination of whether the asset's credit risk has increased significantly reflects comparison of:\n\u2022 its remaining lifetime PD at the reporting date based on the modified terms; with\n\u2022 the remaining lifetime PD estimated based on data at initial recognition and the original contractual\nterms.\nThe Group renegotiates financings to customers in financial difficulties (referred to as 'forbearance\nactivities') to maximize collection opportunities and minimize the risk of default. Under the Bank's\nforbearance policy, financing forbearance is granted on a selective basis if the debtor is currently in default\non its debt or if there is a high risk of default, there is evidence that the debtor made all reasonable efforts\nto pay under the original contractual terms and the debtor is expected to be able to meet the revised terms.\nThe revised terms usually include extending the maturity, changing the timing of profit payments and\namending the terms of financing covenants. Both consumer and commercial financing are subject to the\nforbearance/remedial policy. The Bank Board Risk Committee regularly reviews reports on forbearance\nactivities.\nThe following tables refer to modified financial assets where modification does not result in\nderecognition.\n2024 2023\nSR \u2018000 SR \u2018000\nFinancial assets (with loss allowance based on lifetime ECL) modified\nduring the year\nGross carrying amount before modification 97,098 344,870\nLoss allowance before modification (6,085) (24,828)\nNet amortised cost before modification 91,013 320,042\nNet modification gain - -\nNet amortised cost after modification 91,013 320,042\nFinancial assets modified since initial recognition at a time when loss\nallowance was based on lifetime ECL\nGross carrying amount of financial assets for which loss allowance has\nchanged in the period from lifetime to 12-month ECL 69,661 19,487\nFor financial assets modified as part of the Group's forbearance policy, the estimate of PD reflects whether\nthe modification has improved or restored the Group's ability to collect profit and principal and the Bank's\nprevious experience of similar forbearance action. As part of this process, the Group evaluates the\nborrower's payment performance against the modified contractual terms and considers various\nbehavioural indicators.\n104"

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n32.3 Amounts arising from ECL \u2013 Significant increase in credit risk (\u201cSICR\u201d) (continued)\nd) Modified financial assets (continued)\nGenerally, forbearance is a qualitative indicator of a SICR and an expectation of forbearance may\nconstitute evidence that an exposure is credit-impaired/in default. A customer needs to demonstrate\nconsistently good payment behaviour over a period of time before the exposure is no longer considered\nto be credit-impaired/ in default or the PD is considered to have decreased such that the ECL reverts to\nbeing measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.\ne) Incorporation of forward looking information\nThe Group incorporates forward-looking information into both its assessment of whether the credit risk\nof an instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition and its measurement of ECL.\nBased on advice from the Bank Market Risk Policy Committee, Asset and Liability Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d)\nand economic experts and consideration of a variety of external actual and forecast information, the Group\nformulates a 'base case' view of the future direction of relevant economic variables as well as a\nrepresentative range of other possible forecast scenarios. This process involves developing two or more\nadditional economic scenarios and considering the relative probabilities of each outcome. External\ninformation includes economic data and forecasts published by governmental bodies and monetary\nauthorities in the Saudi Arabia and selected private-sector and academic forecasters.\nThe base case represents a most-likely outcome and is aligned with information used by the Group for\nother purposes such as strategic planning and budgeting. The other scenarios represent more optimistic\nand more pessimistic outcomes. Periodically, the Group carries out stress testing of more extreme shocks\nto calibrate its determination of these other representative scenarios.\nThe Group has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each portfolio of\nfinancial instruments and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macro-\neconomic variables and credit risk and credit losses. The economic scenarios used as at December 31,\n2023 included the following key indicators.\n\u2022 GDP\n\u2022 Oil prices\n\u2022 Unemployment rates\n\u2022 Real wages / inflation rate\nPredicted relationships between the key indicators and default / loss rates on various portfolios of financial\nassets have been developed based on analysing historical data over the past 10 to 15 years. The Group has\nused below base case near term forecast in its ECL model, which is based on updated information available\nas at the reporting date:\nForecast calendar years used in 2024 ECL Forecast calendar years used in 2023 ECL\nEconomic model model\nIndicators 2025 2026 2027 2024 2025 2026\nGDP 3,636.36 3,730.11 2,588.65 2,913.47 3,115.55 3,214.70\nBrent oil prices 68.83 66.85 68.57 81.54 80.01 73.83\n105"

They are adjusted to reflect forward-looking information as described above.\nPD estimates are estimates at a certain date, which are calculated, based on statistical rating models, and\nassessed using rating tools tailored to the various categories of counterparties and exposures. These\nstatistical models are based on internally and externally compiled data comprising both quantitative and\nqualitative factors. Where it is available, market data may also be used to derive the PD for large corporate\ncounterparties. If a counterparty or exposure migrates between ratings classes, then this will lead to a\nchange in the estimate of the associated PD. PDs are estimated considering the contractual maturities of\nexposures and estimated prepayment rates.\nLGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Group estimates LGD for each line of\nbusiness based on expert judgment and historical experience The Group has made an assessment of the\ndata driven approaches for LGD. However, on account of data limitations and associated challenges, the\nGroup uses regulatory LGD benchmarks, based on Basel guidelines and LGD estimates determined in line\nwith National Credit Data Pooling Consortium report.\n106"

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n32.3 Amounts arising from ECL \u2013 Significant increase in credit risk (\u201cSICR\u201d) (continued)\nf) Measurement of ECL (continued)\nEAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Group derives the EAD from the\ncurrent exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract\nincluding amortization. The EAD of a financial asset is its gross carrying amount. For lending\ncommitments and financial guarantees, the EAD includes the amount drawn, as well as potential future\namounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated based on historical observations and\nforward-looking forecasts. For some financial assets, EAD is determined by modelling the range of\npossible exposure outcomes at various points in time using scenario and statistical techniques.\nAs described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for financial assets for which credit\nrisk has not significantly increased, the Group measures ECL considering the risk of default over the\nmaximum contractual period (including any borrower's extension options) over which it is exposed to\ncredit risk, even if, for risk management purposes, the Group considers a longer period. The maximum\ncontractual period extends to the date at which the Group has the right to require repayment of an advance\nor terminate a credit related commitment or guarantee.\nHowever, for retail overdrafts and credit card facilities that include both a financing and an undrawn\ncommitment component, the Group measures ECL over a period longer than the maximum contractual\nperiod if the Group's contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does\nnot limit the Group's exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. These facilities do not have\na fixed term or repayment structure and are managed on a collective basis. The Group can cancel them\nwith immediate effect but this contractual right is not enforced in the normal day-to-day management but\nonly when the Group becomes aware of an increase in credit risk at the facility level. This longer period is\nestimated taking into account the credit risk management actions that the Group expects to take and that\nserve to mitigate ECL. These include a reduction in limits. Cancellation of the facility and/or turning the\noutstanding balance into a financing with fixed repayment terms.\nThe table below illustrates the sensitivity of ECL to key factors used in determining it as at the year-\nend:\nAssumptions sensitized 2024 2023\nSR \u2018000 SR \u2018000\nStatement of income Impact\nMacro-economic factors:\nDecrease in $10 oil price per barrel 56,807 64,475\nDecrease in $20 oil price per barrel 68,758 79,349\nDecrease in GDP by 5% 53,096 60,136\nIncrease in inflation by 10% N/A N/A\nWhere modelling of a parameter is carried out on a collective basis, the financial instruments are grouped\nbased on shared risk characteristics that include:\n\u2022 instrument type;\n\u2022 credit risk grading;\n\u2022 collateral type;\n\u2022 LTV (financing to value) ratio for retail mortgages;\n\u2022 date of initial recognition;\n\u2022 remaining term to maturity;\n\u2022 industry; and\n\u2022 geographic location of the borrower.\n107"

MARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the risk that the Group\u2019s earnings or capital, or its ability to meet business targets, will be\nadversely affected by changes in the level or volatility in market prices, such as profit rates, credit spreads\n(not relating to changes in the obligor's / issuer's credit standing), equity prices and foreign exchange rates.\nThe objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within\nacceptable parameters, while optimising the return.\nThe Group separates its exposure to market risk between trading and non-trading portfolios. Trading\nportfolios mainly are held by the Treasury division and include equity investments and mutual funds that\nare managed on a fair value basis.\nThe Board of Directors (BoD) approves market risk appetite for trading and non-trading activities. The\nMarket Risk Policy Committee is responsible for the Market Risk Framework and under the delegated\nauthority of the Board sets a limits framework within the approved market risk appetite. A daily market\nrisk report details the Group\u2019s market risk exposures against agreed limits. This daily report is reviewed\nby the Treasurer and Chief Risk Officer. The market risk for the trading book is managed and monitored\nusing Value at Risk (VaR) methodology and sensitivity analysis. The market risk for the non-trading book\nis managed and monitored using sensitivity analysis.\na) MARKET RISK - TRADING BOOK\nMarket risk on trading mainly arises from the foreign currency exposures and changes in equity prices\nand the net asset values of mutual funds.\nThe Board has set limits for the acceptable level of risks in managing the trading book. In order to manage\nthe market risk in trading book, the Group periodically applies a VaR methodology to assess the market\nrisk positions held and also to estimate the potential economic loss based on a set of assumptions and\nchanges in market conditions.\n114"

MARKET RISK (continued)\na) MARKET RISK - TRADING BOOK (continued)\nA VaR methodology estimates the potential negative change in market value of a portfolio at a given\nconfidence level and over a specified time horizon. The Group uses historical methodology models to\nassess the possible changes in the market value of the trading book based on historical data. The VaR that\nthe Group measures is an estimate, using a confidence level of 99% of the potential loss that is not\nexpected to be exceeded if the current market positions were to be held unchanged for one day. The use\nof 99% confidence level depicts that within a one-day horizon, losses exceeding VAR figure should occur,\non average, not more than once every hundred days.\nThe VaR represents the risk of portfolios at the close of a business day, and it does not account for any\nlosses that may occur beyond the defined confidence interval. The actual trading results however, may\ndiffer from the VaR calculations and, in particular, the calculation does not provide a meaningful\nindication of profits and losses in stressed market conditions.\nTo overcome the VaR limitations mentioned above, the Group also carries out stress tests of its portfolio\nto simulate conditions outside normal confidence intervals. The potential losses occurring under stress\ntest conditions are reported regularly to the Bank\u2019s Board Risk Committee for their review.\nThe Group\u2019s VaR related information is as under.\n2024 2023\nSR\u2019000 SR\u2019000\nForeign exchange rate\nVaR as at end of the year 33 441\nMinimum VaR 88 91\nMaximum VaR 2,340 2,601\nAverage VaR for the year 330 993\ni) FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK\nCurrency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign\nexchange rates. The Group manages exposure to the effects of fluctuations in prevailing foreign currency\nexchange rates on its financial position and cash flows. The Board has set limits on positions by currency.\nPositions are monitored daily to ensure positions are maintained within established limits.\nAt the end of the year, the Group has the following significant exposure in its trading book, denominated\nin foreign currencies as at December 31:\n2024 2023\nSR\u2019000 SR\u2019000\nUS Dollar 1,297,013 1,281,461\nAustralian dollars - 110,222\nPound Sterling 57,536 64,339\nHong Kong Dollar - 2,275\nTaiwan Dollar 588 3,286\nUAE Dirhams 19,263 -\nIndonesian Rupiah 2,376 -\nSouth Korean Won 8,612 -\nThe table below indicates the extent to which the Group was exposed to currency risk at December 31,\non its foreign currency positions.

The Group's Market Risk Policy Committee (MRPC) has established\nlimits on the profit rate gap. Positions are monitored on a daily basis and reported regularly to senior\nmanagement and MRPC to ensure positions are maintained within the established limits. In case of\nstressed market conditions, the asset-liability gap may be reported to MRPC more frequently.\nThe following table depicts the sensitivity due to reasonably possible changes in profit rates, with other\nvariables held constant, on the Group\u2019s consolidated statement of income. The sensitivity of the income\nis the effect of the assumed changes in profit rates on the net financing and investment income for one\nyear, based on the profit bearing non-trading financial assets and financial liabilities held as at December\n31, 2024 including the effect of hedging instruments. All the non-trading book exposures are monitored\nand analysed in currency concentrations and relevant sensitivities are disclosed in local currency. The\nsensitivity analysis does not take account of actions that might be taken by the Group to mitigate the effect\nof such changes.\n117"

LIQUIDITY RISK\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Bank will be unable to meet its payment obligations when they become\ndue, both under normal and stressful conditions. Market disruptions or credit downgrades can cause\nliquidity risk, making certain sources of funding less readily available. To mitigate this risk, management\nhas diversified its funding sources beyond its core deposit base, manages assets with a focus on liquidity,\nmaintaining an appropriate balance of cash, cash equivalents, and readily marketable securities, and\nmonitors future cash flows and liquidity on a daily basis. In addition, the Group has committed lines of\ncredit that can be used to meet any liquidity needs.\nIn accordance with the Banking Control Law and the regulations issued by SAMA, the Group maintains a\nstatutory deposit with SAMA at 7% of total demand deposits and 4% of savings and time deposits. In\naddition to the statutory deposit, the Group also maintains liquid reserves of not less than 20% of the deposit\nliabilities, in the form of cash or assets that can be converted into cash within a period not exceeding 30\ndays. The Group has the ability to raise additional funds through repo facilities available with SAMA up to\n98% of the value of debt securities issued by the government and 90% of the value of debt securities issued\nMinistry of Finance, Saudi Central Bank and or guaranteed by government.\nIn addition, the Group keeps a Liquidity Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) in place to provide guidance to\nsenior management. The CFP establishes early warning indicators to alert management of impending stress,\nestablishes responsibilities, and describes the approach management may take at various stages of crisis\nseverity.\na) Analysis of financial liabilities by remaining undiscounted contractual maturities\nThe table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities at December 31, 2024\nand December 31, 2023 based on contractual undiscounted repayment obligations. As profit payments up\nto contractual maturity are included in the table, totals do not match with the consolidated statement of\nfinancial position. The contractual maturities of liabilities have been determined on the basis of the\nremaining period at the reporting date to the contractual maturity date and do not take into account the\neffective expected maturities as shown in note (b) below (maturity analysis of assets and liabilities for the\nexpected maturities). Repayments which are subject to notice are treated as if notice were to be given\nimmediately. However, the Group expects that many customers will not request repayment on the earliest\ndate the Group could be required to pay and the table does not reflect the expected cash flows indicated by\nthe Group\u2019s deposit retention history and liquidity risk management policy.\n124"

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the\nmost advantageous market to which the Group has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects\nits non-performance risk.\nDetermination of fair value and fair value hierarchy\nThe Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial\ninstruments:\nLevel 1: Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\nLevel 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable either directly (i.e. as\nprices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This category includes instruments valued\nusing: quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments; quoted prices for\nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less than active or other\nvaluation techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from\nmarket data\nLevel 3: Inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments for which the valuation\ntechnique include inputs that are not observable and the unobservable inputs have a\nsignificant effect on the instrument\u2019s valuation. This category includes instruments that are\nvalued based on quoted prices for similar instruments for which significant unobservable\nadjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments\u201d\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognised at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines\nwhether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on\nthe lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each\nreporting period.\nThere were no changes in the Group\u2019s valuation processes, valuation techniques, and types of inputs used\nin the fair value measurements during the period.\na) The following table presents the Group\u2019s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair values:\n2024 (SR\u2019000)\nCarrying Fair Value\nValue Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nFinancial assets measured at fair\nvalue:\nFVIS - Mutual funds 1,748,147 - 1,748,147 - 1,748,147\nFVIS \u2013 Equities 39,853 17,264 - 22,589 39,853\nFVIS \u2013 Convertible debt instrument 6,618 - - 6,618 6,618\nFVOCI \u2013 Equities 531,274 - - 531,274 531,274\nFVOCI \u2013 Sukuk \u2013 equity 2,999,378 - 2,999,378 - 2,999,378\nFVOCI \u2013 Sukuk \u2013 debt 9,784,586 - 9,784,586 - 9,784,586\nShari\u2019ah compliant derivatives 151,737 - 151,737 - 151,737\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nTotal 15,261,593 17,264 14,683,848 560,481 15,261,593\n\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\nFinancial liabilities measured at fair\nvalue:\nShari\u2019ah compliant derivatives 164,999 - 164,999 - 164,999\n\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550 \u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\u2550\n130"

SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE RELATED EXPENSES (continued)\nThe Bank has developed a Senior Management Compensation & Benefits Policy based on the \u2018Rules on\nCompensation Practices\u2019 issued by SAMA as well as the guidelines provided by the Financial Stability\nBoard and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in this respect. The policy was approved by the\nGeneral Assembly and prioritizes the alignment of compensation with risk and offers a competitive and\nbalanced mix of fixed and variable pay. The policy ensures that compensation reflects the probability and\ntiming of earnings and their effect on the Bank\u2019s capital. It also aims to foster effective risk management,\nachieve financial stability and address the risks arising from the Bank\u2019s compensation practices. The\nGroup considers all kinds of current and potential material risks and maintains a balance between general\nindustry practices and Group-specific factors such as business model, financial condition, operating\nperformance, market perception, business prospects and suitable managerial judgement, etc.\nThe Board of Directors of the Bank has established a Nomination and Remuneration Committee (the\nCommittee) which consists of four members. The functions and duties of the committee focus on\nrecommending nominations to the Board of Directors as per the approved policies and standards,\nperforming annual reviews on the skills required for the membership of the board of directors, performing\nreviews of the board of directors \u2018structure and recommending those changes that could be carried out.\nThe committee is also responsible for ensuring the independence of independent members and lack of any\nconflict of interests in case any director was a member in any other company\u2019s board, ensuring\nrecommended appointment is commensurate with the proper skills and required qualifications, and\ndevelopment and review of remuneration for the directors and senior executives.\nThe Committee is also responsible to recommend to the Board of Directors the approval of the Bank\u2019s\nCompensation Policy and any amendments thereto, to ensure that the Bank\u2019s remuneration policies are in\ncompliance with SAMA Rules, to periodically review the Bank\u2019s compensation policy, to evaluate\npractices by which compensation is paid, and to determine the performance bonuses for the Bank\u2019s\nemployees based on the risk adjusted profit of the Bank.\nThe governance process ensures that the Compensation Policy is consistently applied and operates as\nintended. The Bank has established an oversight mechanism to regularly evaluate the design\ncharacteristics of compensation practices and their implementation to achieve the desired objectives\nThe compensation and benefits program\nThe Compensation Policy is designed to attract, retain and motivate high performing and high potential\nemployees. The Group\u2019s compensation policy is based on the nature of the job, market practices and\njobholder\u2019s level of involvement in risk taking and controlling activities. The policy applies to all\nemployees, including the executive management team and aims to link individual performance to the\nGroup\u2019s overall achievements and financial soundness and results.\nThe Banks participates in Compensation and Benefits surveys conducted by independent third parties to\nget insights into the market pay levels. The Bank also conducts annual performance cycles that ensures\nthat employees are appraised of their annual performance.\nThe distribution of compensation is composed of a mix of fixed and variable pay, allowances, periodic\nmeritorious reward schemes and non-cash benefits in line with the standards and norms for the financial\nservices industry in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nAccording to labour law of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Group\u2019s internal policies, staff end of\nservices benefits is due for payment at the end of an employee\u2019s period of services.

SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE RELATED EXPENSES (continued)\nThe compensation and benefits program is applicable to all regular (Headcount) Saudi national and\nexpatriate employees of the Bank, and its subsidiaries within all applicable regulatory and corporate\ngovernance limitations.\n\u2022 Fixed compensation includes salaries and wages, and job/position specific allowances and related\nbenefits, which are fixed in employment contracts and are given irrespective of performance.\n\u2022 Variable compensation includes performance bonuses, incentives and other variable performance\nrelated allowances which are not fixed by the employment contracts, and which vary from year to\nyear, and have a direct correlation with individual, group and institutional performance success.\nPerformance management system\nThe Bank has adopted a framework to develop a clear link between variable compensation and\nperformance. The framework is designed on the basis that the combination of meeting both financial\nperformance and achievement of other non-financial factors would deliver a target bonus pool for the\nemployees, prior to consideration of any allocation to business areas and employees individually.\nThe performance of all employees is evaluated against agreed targets using a KPI and Competency\nScorecard methodology. Financial and non-financial metrics are used to measure performance against the\nobjectives, which include profitability, expense control, customer satisfaction, quality assurance,\nemployee development and engagement, sustainable business practices, lending guidelines, internal\ncontrols, compliance with regulations, and business systems and processes. Effective risk management is\nemphasized to maintain a strong and secure operating platform. The performance management\nmethodology at BAJ focuses on the differentiation of individual performance and drives the variable\nreward strategy which encourages high performance within a risk compliant manner.\nIn line with SAMA Regulations, Material Risk Takers (MRTs) have a percentage of their variable\ncompensation deferred and vested over a period of three (3) years. The MRTs are determined every year\nand approved by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.\nRisk-adjustment for variable pay schemes\nThe Bank has adopted a framework to develop a clear link between variable compensation and\nperformance. The Bank has reviewed all its variable pay schemes, to ensure that any bonus pay pools have\ntaken into account all relevant risks. The determination of bonus pools is based on appropriate\nperformance factors adjusted for risk. The bonus pool for the Control functions have been ring fenced\nfrom short-term profits in alignment with SAMA regulations.\nThe Bank\u2019s subsidiaries have adopted a similar approach to remuneration and compensation practices as\ndescribed above, including policies within a framework of prudent risk management.\n138"

The adequacy of\nthe Group\u2019s capital is monitored using, among other measures, the rules and ratios established by the\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision including the framework and guidance regarding the\nimplementation of capital reforms under Basel III (\u201cBasel III Accord\u201d) which has been adopted by the\nBank\u2019s regulator, SAMA. The Basel III capital ratios measure capital adequacy by comparing the Group\u2019s\neligible capital with its balance sheet assets, commitments and notional amount of derivatives at a\nweighted amount to reflect their relative risk. SAMA requires holding a minimum level of regulatory\ncapital and maintaining a ratio of total regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets (\u201cRWA\u201d) at or above\n10.5 percent. including a capital conservation buffer (2.5 percent).\nThe Group monitors the adequacy of its capital using the methodology and ratios established by SAMA.\nVarious committees have been established by the Bank which also monitor the capital adequacy.\nThe following table summarizes the Group's Pillar-I Risk Weighted Assets (RWA), Regulatory Capital\nand Capital Adequacy Ratios as per as per Basel III final reform issued by SAMA (circular number\n44047144) effective from January 01, 2023\n2024 2023\nCapital Capital\nEligible capital Eligible capital\nadequacy ratio adequacy ratio\nSR \u2019000 SR \u2019000\n% %\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (CET 1)\nCapital 13,288,378 12.11% 12,721,256 13.27%\nAdditional Tier 1 (AT1) Capital 3,875,000 - 3,875,000 -\nTier I Capital 17,163,378 15.64% 16,596,256 17.31%\nSupplementary capital (Tier 2) 2,616,245 2,501,906\nCore and supplementary capital\n(Tier 1 + Tier 2) 19,779,623 18.02% 19,098,162 19.92%\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital of the Bank at the year-end comprises of share capital, statutory reserve,\ngeneral reserves, other reserves, retained earnings and certain regulatory capital adjustments in\naccordance with the requirement of SAMA Basel III Framework.

As a result, the comparative figures also reflect this change.\nd) Basis for determining any IRR and the changes that have occurred in any of those reserves\nduring the reporting period\nInvestment risk reserve / Mudaraba Reserve (IRR) is created by setting aside amounts out of the profit\nattributable to investment account holders, after deducing the Mudarib share, in order to cushion the\neffects of future investment losses on investment account holders. The IRR enables the Bank's to cover,\nfully or partially, unexpected losses on investments. Where the losses are fully covered, use of PER may\nenable a profit pay-out to be made to the IAH notwithstanding the loss.\nWith regard to IRR, IAH agree in advance in the contract that regulates their relationship with Bank, on\nthe proportion of their income that may be appropriated to each of these reserves. This amount is\ndetermined by the management of the Bank at their discretion. As per terms and conditions, in case of\nany shortfall the Bank has to first utilise any amount available in the Mudaraba Reserve and in case of\nany shortfall may (at its sole discretion) elect (but shall not be obliged) to make one or more payments\nfrom its own cash resources in order to cover such shortfall and the Bank will be entitled to recover such\namounts at a later date from the Mudaraba Reserve.\nInvestment risk reserve (IRR) are used to manage and mitigate below risk faced by Bank.\nDisplaced commercial risk\nRate of return risk can give rise to displaced commercial risk. Bank may be under pressure to pay a return\nthat is above the rate earned on assets to match the competitors\u2019 rates. Bank cannot provide their\ncustomers fixed guaranteed returns on their deposits or investments. Instead, they follow risk/return\nsharing model. However, in practice, investment account holders are likely to expect competitive returns.\nThis lead to displaced commercial risk for Banks. It is vital for Banks to effectively manage their\ndisplaced commercial risk to be able to compete with their conventional counterparts. To mitigate\ndisplaced commercial risk, Banks may decide to waive their portions of profits and thus dissuade\ninvestment account holders from withdrawing funds. However, the practice of foregoing part or all of\nshareholders\u2019 profits can adversely affect the Bank\u2019s own capital which can lead to insolvency in extreme\ncases.\n143"
